## The problem
Ableton Live 12 is the new version of Ableton Live, but the manual of the product can be read online only (at the moment)

A lot of people need to be able to read the manual offline in the tablet, computer or other device

To help with this, this project generates the content into HTML and PDF formats

> Note: This project lets you generate the PDF document for the version 11 and version 12. You can modify the settings of this application to point the correct version and language. However, and in this moment, Ableton has the documentation for the version 12 in English only
