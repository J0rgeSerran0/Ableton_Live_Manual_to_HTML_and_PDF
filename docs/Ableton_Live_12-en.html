Live Sets reside in a Live Project — a folder that collects related materials. Once the Project folder is saved, the Set can be opened again using the File menu’s Open command.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/LiveSetInBrowser.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Live Set in the Browser.</figcaption></figure><p>The Live Project folder and related files belonging to the currently open Live Set are also accessible via the Current Project label in Live’s Places.</p></section><section id="arrangement-and-session" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="3.3"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Arrangement and Session</h2><p>The basic musical building blocks of Live are called <em>clips</em>. A clip is a piece of musical material: a melody, a drum pattern, a bassline or a complete song. Live allows you to record and alter clips, and to create larger musical structures from them: songs, scores, remixes, DJ sets or stage shows.</p><p>A Live Set consists of two environments that can hold clips: The <em>Arrangement</em> is a layout of clips along a musical and linear timeline; the <em>Session</em> is a real-time-oriented “launching base” for clips. Every Session clip has its own play button that allows launching the clip at any time and in any order. Each clip’s behavior upon launch can be precisely specified through a number of settings (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/launching-clips/#launching-clips">‘Launching Clips’</a>).</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ClipsInSessionAndArrangement.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Clips in the Arrangement View (Left) and in the Session View (Right).</figcaption></figure><p>The Arrangement is accessed via the Arrangement View (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/arrangement-view/#arrangement-view">‘Arrangement View’</a>) and the Session via the Session View (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/session-view/#session-view">‘Session View’</a>).</p><p>If you’re using Live in a single window, you can toggle between the two views using the computer’s <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or their respective view controls at the top right corner of Live’s window. If you’re using two windows, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> will swap the Session and Arrangement from one window to the other. Note that if the ‘Use Tab Key to Navigate’ option is enabled in the Display &amp; Input Preferences, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> will not switch between Arrangement and Session View. However, you can switch between the views using their Navigate menu entries or the shortcuts <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>1</kbd> for Session View and <kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>2</kbd> for Arrangement View.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArrangementAndSessionSelectors.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Arrangement and Session View Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>Because the two views have distinct applications, they each hold individual collections of clips. However, it is important to understand that toggling or swapping the views simply changes the appearance of the Live Set and does not switch modes, alter what you hear or change what is stored.</p><p>The Arrangement View and the Session View interact in useful ways. One can, for instance, improvise with Session clips and record a log of the improvisation (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/session-view/#recording-sessions-into-the-arrangement">‘Recording Sessions into the Arrangement’</a>) into the Arrangement for further refinement. This works because Arrangement and Session are connected via <em>tracks</em>.</p></section><section id="tracks" data-number="1.4"><h2 data-number="3.4"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Tracks</h2><p>Tracks host clips and also manage the flow of signals, as well as the creation of new clips through recording, sound synthesis, effects processing and mixing.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArrangementTrack.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Track in the Arrangement View.</figcaption></figure><p>The Session and Arrangement share the same set of tracks. In the Session View, the tracks are laid out in columns, while in the Arrangement View they are stacked vertically, with time moving from left to right. A simple rule governs the cohabitation of clips in a track:</p><p><em>A track can only play one clip at a time.</em></p><p>Therefore, one usually puts clips that should play alternatively in the same Session View column, and spreads out clips that should play together across tracks in rows, or what we call scenes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/session-view/#tracks-and-scenes">‘Tracks and Scenes’</a>).</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SessionViewScene.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Scene in the Session View.</figcaption></figure><p>At any one time, a track can be playing either a Session clip or an Arrangement clip, but never both. So, who wins? When a Session clip is launched, the respective track stops whatever it is doing to play that clip. In particular, if the track was playing an Arrangement clip, it will stop it in favor of the Session clip — even as the other tracks continue to play what is in the Arrangement. The track will not resume Arrangement playback until explicitly told to do so.</p><p>This is what the <em>Back to Arrangement</em> button is for, which is found in the <em>Main track</em> in the Session View and at the top-right of the scrub area in the Arrangement View. This button lights up to indicate that one or more tracks are currently <em>not</em> playing the Arrangement, but are playing a clip from the Session instead.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/BackToArrangementButtonSession.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=210"><figcaption>The Back to Arrangement Button in the Session View.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/BackToArrangementButtonArrangement.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Back to Arrangement Button in the Arrangement View.</figcaption></figure><p>We can click this button to make all tracks go back to playing the Arrangement.

Live deals with two types of signals: audio and MIDI. In the digital world, an audio signal is a series of numbers that approximates a continuous signal as generated by a microphone or delivered to a loudspeaker. A MIDI signal is a sequence of commands, such as “now play a C4 at mezzo piano.“ MIDI is a symbolic representation of musical material, one that is closer to a written score than to an audio recording. MIDI signals are generated by input devices such as MIDI or USB keyboards <span class="footnote">(For an introduction to MIDI and digital audio, please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio</a>.)</span>.</p><p>It takes an instrument (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#working-with-instruments-and-effects">‘Working with Instruments and Effects’</a>) to convert MIDI signals into audio signals that can actually be heard. Some instruments, such as Live’s Simpler (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#simpler">‘Simpler’</a>), are for chromatic playing of one sound via the keyboard. Other instruments, such as Live’s Impulse (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#impulse">‘Impulse’</a>), have a different percussion sound assigned to each keyboard key.</p><p>Audio signals are recorded and played back using <em>audio tracks</em>, and MIDI signals are recorded and played back using <em>MIDI tracks</em>. The two track types have their own corresponding clip types. Audio clips cannot live on MIDI tracks and vice versa.</p><p>Information about inserting, reordering and deleting audio and MIDI tracks is found here (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#audio-and-midi-tracks">‘Audio and MIDI Tracks’</a>).</p></section><section id="audio-clips-and-samples" data-number="1.6"><h2 data-number="3.6"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Audio Clips and Samples</h2><p>An audio clip contains a reference to a <em>sample</em> (also known as a “sound file“ or “audio file“) or a <em>compressed sample</em> (such as an MP3 file). The clip tells Live where on the computer’s drives to find the sample, what part of the sample to play and <em>how</em> to play it.</p><p>When a sample is dragged in from Live’s built-in browser, Live automatically creates a clip to play that sample. Prior to dragging in a sample, one can audition or <em>preview</em> it directly in the browser; the switch in the browser with the headphone icon activates previewing.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/FileBrowserWithSamples.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Selected Sample with Audio Preview in the Browser.</figcaption></figure><p>Live offers many options for playing samples in exciting new ways, allowing you to create an abundance of new sounds without actually changing the original sample — all the changes are computed in real time, while the sample is played. The respective settings are made in the Clip View (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-view/#clip-view">‘Clip View’</a>), which appears on screen when a clip is double-clicked.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ClipView.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>An Audio Clip’s Properties as Displayed in the Clip View.</figcaption></figure><p>Many powerful manipulations arise from Live’s warping capabilities (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#time-warping-samples">‘Time-Warping Samples’</a>). Warping means changing the speed of sample playback independently from the pitch so as to match the song tempo. The tempo can be adjusted on the fly in the Control Bar’s Tempo field.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TempoControl.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Control Bar’s Tempo Field.</figcaption></figure><p>The most elementary use of this technique, and one that usually requires no manual setup, is synchronizing sample loops to the chosen tempo. Live’s Auto-Warp algorithm actually makes it easy to line up <em>any</em> sample with the song tempo, such as a recording of a drunken jazz band’s performance. It is also possible to radically change the sonic signature of a sound using extreme warp settings.</p></section><section id="midi-clips-and-midi-files" data-number="1.7"><h2 data-number="3.7"><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> MIDI Clips and MIDI Files</h2><p>A MIDI clip contains musical material in the form of MIDI notes and controller envelopes. When MIDI is imported from a MIDI file (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#midi-files">‘MIDI Files’</a>), the data gets incorporated into the Live Set, and the original file is not referenced thereafter.

In practice, the computer’s processor speed imposes a limit on the number of devices you can use at the same time, a topic that deserves separate discussion (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/computer-audio-resources-and-strategies/#managing-the-cpu-load">‘Managing the CPU Load’</a>). Note that the signal connections between audio devices are always stereo, but the software’s inputs and outputs can be configured to be mono in the Audio Preferences.</p><p>When the signal has passed through the device chain, it ends up in Live’s mixer (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#the-live-mixer">‘The Live Mixer’</a>). As the Session and Arrangement share the same set of tracks, they also share the mixer. The mixer can be shown in both views for convenience.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MixerInArrangement.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Live Mixer in the Arrangement View.</figcaption></figure><p>To optimize the screen layout, the individual mixer sections can be shown or hidden using the View menu’s “Mixer Controls” entries or menu next to the mixer view control at the bottom right corner of Live’s window.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MixerControlsMenu.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Mixer Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>The mixer has controls for volume, pan position and <em>sends</em>, which adjust the contribution each track makes to the input of any <em>return tracks</em>. Return tracks only host effects, and not clips. Via their sends, all tracks can feed a part of their signal into a return track and share its effects.</p><p>The mixer also includes a crossfader (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#using-lives-crossfader">‘Using Live’s Crossfader’</a>), which can create smooth transitions between clips playing on different tracks. Live’s crossfader works like a typical DJ mixer crossfader, except that it allows crossfading not only two but any number of tracks — including the returns.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CrossfaderAndButtons.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Crossfader and Track Crossfader Assign Buttons.</figcaption></figure><p>Devices that receive and deliver audio signals are called <em>audio effects</em>. Audio effects are the only type of device that fit in an audio track or a return track. However, two more types of devices are available for use in MIDI tracks: <em>MIDI effects</em> and <em>instruments</em>.</p><p>Consider a MIDI track playing a clip. The MIDI signal from the clip is fed into the track’s device chain. There, it is first processed by any number of MIDI effects. A MIDI effect receives and delivers MIDI signals. One example is the Scale effect, which maps the incoming notes onto a user-defined musical scale. The last MIDI effect in the chain is followed by an instrument. Instruments, for instance Live’s Simpler and Impulse, receive MIDI and deliver audio. Following the instrument, there can be any number of audio effects — as in an audio track.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MIDITrackView.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A MIDI Effect, an Instrument and Some Audio Effects in a MIDI Track.</figcaption></figure><p>If a MIDI track has no instrument (and no audio effects), then the track’s output is a plain MIDI signal, which has to be sent somewhere else to be converted into audio. In this case, the track’s mix and Send controls disappear from the mixer.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MixerForTrackWOInstrument.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Mixer for a MIDI Track without an Instrument.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="presets-and-racks" data-number="1.9"><h2 data-number="3.9"><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Presets and Racks</h2><p>Every Live device can store and retrieve particular sets of parameter values as presets (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#live-device-presets">‘Live Device Presets’</a>).

Where do these signals go? This is set up in the mixer’s <em>In/Out section</em>, which offers, for every track, choosers to select a signal source and destination. The In/Out section, accessible through the View menu’s In/Out option, is Live’s “patchbay.“ Its routing options (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#routing-and-i-o">‘Routing and I/O’</a>) enable valuable creative and technical methods such as resampling, submixing, layering of synths, complex effects setups and more.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TrackInOutSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Track Routing Is Set up Using the In/Out Section in the Arrangement (Left) or Session View (Right).</figcaption></figure><p>Signals from the tracks can be sent to the outside world via the computer’s audio and MIDI interfaces, to other programs that are connected to other tracks or devices within Live. Tracks can also be combined into a Group Track (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#group-tracks">‘Group Tracks’</a>) which serves as a submixer for the selected tracks.</p><p>Likewise, a track can be set up to receive an input signal to be played through the track’s devices. Again, tracks can receive their input from the outside or from another track or device in Live. The <em>Monitor</em> controls regulate the conditions under which the input signal is heard through the track.</p><p>It is also possible to route signals to external hardware devices from within a track’s device chain, by using the External Audio Effect (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#external-audio-effect">‘External Audio Effect’</a>) and External Instrument (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#external-instrument">‘External Instrument’</a>) devices.

Recording is enabled on a track by pressing its <em>Arm button</em>. With multiple tracks selected, pressing any of their Arm buttons will arm all of them. You can also hold down the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) modifier when clicking the Arm buttons to arm several tracks at once. If the Exclusive Arm option is enabled in the Record Preferences, inserting an instrument into a new or empty MIDI track will automatically arm the track. When the Control Bar’s Arrangement Record button is on, every armed track records its input signal into the Arrangement. Every take yields a new clip per track.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArmedSessionTrack.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Track Arm Buttons, as They Appear in the Session View.</figcaption></figure><p>It is also possible to record into Session View slots on the fly (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/recording-new-clips/#recording-into-session-slots">‘Recording Into Session Slots’</a>). This technique is very useful for the jamming musician, as Session recording does not require stopping the music. Clicking the Session Record button records a new clip in the selected Session scene in all armed tracks.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SessionRecordButton.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Control Bar’s Session Record Button.</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking the Session Record button again defines the end of the recording and launches the new clips.

The movement of a control across the Arrangement timeline or Session clip is called automation (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/automation-and-editing-envelopes/#automation-and-editing-envelopes">‘Automation and Editing Envelopes’</a>); a control whose value changes over time is <em>automated</em>. Automation is represented by <em>breakpoint envelopes</em>, which can be drawn, edited and recorded in real-time.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArrangementPanControlAndEnvelope.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Automated Parameters in the Arrangement View</figcaption></figure><p>Practically all mixer and effect controls in Live can be automated, even the song tempo. Recording automation is straightforward: all changes of a control that occur while the Control Bar’s Automation Arm and Arrangement Record buttons are on become automation in the Arrangement View. Automation is recorded to Session View clips if controls are adjusted while recording with the Automation Arm button enabled.</p><p>Changing an automated control’s value while <em>not</em> recording is similar to launching a Session clip while the Arrangement is playing: It deactivates the control’s automation (in favor of the new control setting). The control will stop tracking its automation and rest with the new value until the Re-Enable Automation button is pressed or a Session clip that contains automation is launched.</p></section><section id="clip-envelopes" data-number="1.13"><h2 data-number="3.13"><span class="header-section-number">3.13</span> Clip Envelopes</h2><p>Envelopes can be found in both tracks and clips. Clip envelopes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-envelopes/#clip-envelopes">‘Clip Envelopes’</a>) are used to automate or modulate device and mixer controls. Audio clips have, in addition, clip envelopes to influence the clip’s pitch, volume and more; these can be used to change the melody and rhythm of recorded audio. MIDI clips have additional clip envelopes to represent MIDI controller data. Clip envelopes can be <em>unlinked</em> from the clip to give them independent loop settings, so that larger movements (like fade-outs) or smaller gestures (like an arpeggio) can be superimposed onto the clip’s material.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ClipEnvelopeForTranspose.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>An Envelope for Clip Transposition.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="midi-and-key-remote" data-number="1.14"><h2 data-number="3.14"><span class="header-section-number">3.14</span> MIDI and Key Remote</h2><p>To liberate the musician from the mouse, most of Live’s controls can be “remote-controlled“ via an external MIDI controller. Remote mappings are established in MIDI Map Mode (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/midi-and-key-remote-control/#assigning-midi-remote-control">‘Assigning MIDI Remote Control’</a>), which is engaged by pressing the MIDI switch in the Control Bar.</p><p>In this mode, you can click on any mixer or effect control, and then assign it to a controller simply by sending the desired MIDI message (for example, by turning a knob on your MIDI control box). Your assignments take effect immediately after you leave MIDI Map Mode. Session clips can be mapped to a MIDI key or even a keyboard range for chromatic playing.</p><p>MIDI keys and controllers that have been mapped to Live’s controls are not available for recording via MIDI tracks. These messages are filtered out before the incoming MIDI is passed on to the MIDI tracks.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MidiKeyMapSwitchesAndIndicators.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Key/MIDI Map Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>Session clips, switches, buttons and radio buttons can be mapped to computer keyboard keys as well.

The links between samples and their clips can be preserved with a special command, Collect and Save (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#collecting-external-files">‘Collecting External Files’</a>), which makes a copy of each sample and stores it in a project folder along with the Live Set.</p><p>A separate Save button in the Clip Title Bar of an audio clip can be used to save a set of default clip settings (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-view/#saving-default-audio-clip-settings-with-the-sample">‘Saving Default Audio Clip Settings with the Sample’</a>) along with the sample, so that each time the sample is dragged into the program, it will automatically appear with these settings. This is especially useful if you have specific warp settings for a clip that you want to use in multiple Live Sets.</p><p>Exporting audio from Live can be done from both the Session and Arrangement Views by selecting ‘Export Audio/Video’ from the File menu or by using the shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>R</kbd> (Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>R</kbd>.

This chapter will explain everything you need to know about working with each of these file types in Live.</p><section id="sample-files" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="4.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Sample Files</h2><p>A <em>sample</em> is a file that contains audio data. Live can play both uncompressed file formats (WAV, AIF and Sound Designer II for Mac) and compressed file formats (MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, Ogg FLAC and FLAC). (Please note that not all of these file formats can be played in the Lite Edition.)</p><p><em>A note on using Variable Bit Rate (VBR) files</em>: Please install QuickTime for decoding purposes if you do not already have it on your system. It can be downloaded from the Apple website <span class="footnote">(see <a href="https://www.apple.com/quicktime/download" class="uri">https://www.apple.com/quicktime/download</a>)</span>.</p><p>As Live plays the samples directly from disk, you can work with a large number of (large) samples without running into RAM memory limitations. Please note, however, that you may run into disk throughput problems if your disk is nearly full, and/or (on Windows systems) highly fragmented. Hard drive rotation speed can also affect disk performance. Refer to the section on managing the disk load (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/computer-audio-resources-and-strategies/#managing-the-disk-load">‘Managing the Disk Load’</a>) for more information.</p><p>Live can combine uncompressed mono or stereo samples of any length, sample rate or bit depth without prior conversion. To play a compressed sample, Live decodes the sample and writes the result to a temporary, uncompressed sample file. This usually happens quickly enough that you will be able to play the sample right away, without waiting for the decoding process to finish.</p><p>Note: When adding a long sample to a project, Live might tell you that it cannot play the sample before it has been analyzed. Please see the section on analysis (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#analysis-files-asd">‘Analysis Files (.asd)’</a>) for an explanation.</p><section id="the-decoding-cache" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="4.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> The Decoding Cache</h3><p>To save computational resources, Live keeps the decoded sample files of compressed samples in the <em>cache</em>. Maintenance of the cache is normally not required, as Live automatically deletes older files to make room for those that are new. You can, however, impose limits on the cache size using the File &amp; Folder Preferences’ Decoding Cache section. The cache will not grow larger than the Maximum Cache Size setting, and it will always leave the Minimum Free Space on the hard disk. Pressing the nearby Cleanup button will delete all files not being used by the current Live Set.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/DecodingCachePrefs.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Preferences for the Decoding Cache.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="analysis-files-.asd" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="4.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Analysis Files (.asd)</h3><p>An <em>analysis file</em> is a little file that Live creates when a sample file is brought into the program for the first time. The analysis file contains data gathered by Live to help optimize the stretching quality, speed up the waveform display and automatically detect the tempo of long samples (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#syncing-longer-pieces">‘Syncing Longer Pieces’</a>).</p><p>When adding a long sample to a project, Live might tell you that it cannot play the sample before it has been analyzed. This will <em>not</em> happen if the sample has already been analyzed (i.e., Live finds an analysis file for this sample), or if the Record, Warp &amp; Launch Preferences’ Auto-Warp Long Samples preference (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#time-warping-samples">‘Time-Warping Samples’</a>) has been deactivated.</p><p>An analysis file can also store <em>default clip settings</em> for the sample:</p><p>Clicking the Clip View’s Save button (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-view/#saving-default-audio-clip-settings-with-the-sample">‘Saving Default Audio Clip Settings with the Sample’</a>) will store the current clip’s settings with the sample’s analysis file. The next time the sample is dragged into Live, it will appear with all its clip settings intact. This is particularly useful for retaining Warp Marker settings with the sample. Storing default clip settings with the analysis file is different from saving the clip as a Live Clip.</p><p>While analysis files are a handy way to store default information about a particular sample’s settings, keep in mind that you can use different settings for each clip within a Live Set — even if those clips refer to the same sample on disk. But if you drag a <em>new</em> version of the sample into a Live Set, Live will use the settings stored in the analysis file for the newly created clip.</p><p>The analysis file’s name is the same as that of the associated sample, with an added “.asd“ extension. Live puts this analysis file in the same folder as the sample.</p><p><span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SampleWithASDInBrowser.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> Samples that have an .asd file are displayed like this in the browser.</p><p><span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SampleWithoutASDInBrowser.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> Samples without an .asd file look like this.</p><p>The analysis files themselves do not appear in Live’s browser.</p><p>Note that you can suppress the creation of .asd files by turning off the Create Analysis Files option in the File &amp; Folder Preferences.

This is especially useful when rendering material for a live performance, or when providing stems to a mixing engineer or remix artist.</li><li><em>Render as Loop</em> — If this is activated, Live will create a sample that can be used as a loop. For example, suppose your Live Set uses a delay effect. If Render as Loop is on, Live will go through the rendering process twice: The first pass will not actually write samples to disk, but add the specified delay effect. As the second pass starts writing audio to disk, it will include the delay “tail“ resulting from the first pass.</li><li><em>Convert to Mono</em> — If this is activated, Live will create a mono file instead of a stereo file.</li><li><em>Normalize</em> — If this is activated, the sample resulting from the render process will be normalized (i.e., the file will be amplified so that the highest peak attains the maximum available headroom).</li><li><em>Create Analysis File</em> — If this is activated, Live will create an .asd file that contains analysis information about the rendered sample. If you intend to use the new sample in Live, check this option.</li><li><em>Sample Rate</em> — Note that your choice of sample rate works as follows: if you select a sample rate equal to or higher than the rate you’re using in your project (as set in the Audio tab of Live’s Preferences), Live will export in a single step, at the sample rate you’ve chosen in the Export dialog. If you export at a sample rate that is <em>lower</em> than your current project sample rate, Live will first export at the current project sample rate and then downsample the file in a second step using a high-quality process.

Rectangular mode introduces an even smaller amount of dither noise, but at the expense of additional quantization error. The three Pow-r modes offer successively higher amounts of dithering, but with the noise pushed above the audible range. Note that dithering is a procedure that should only be applied once to any given audio file. If you plan to do further processing on your rendered file, it’s best to render to 32-bit to avoid the need for dithering at this stage. In particular, the Pow-r modes should never be used for any material that will be sent on to a further mastering stage — these are for final output only. (Please note that the Pow-r modes are not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</li><li>Encode MP3 — If activated, a CBR 320 kbps MP3 file is created.

Note that this option is only enabled if you have video clips in the Arrangement View. Also, it is not possible to only render a video file — enabling video rendering will always produce a video in addition to rendered audio.</li><li><em>Video Encoder</em> — This chooser allows you to select the encoder to use for the video rendering. The choices you have here depend on the encoders you have installed.</li><li><em>Video Encoder Settings</em> — This button opens the settings window for the selected encoder. Note that the settings options will vary depending on the encoder you have chosen. Certain encoders have no user-configurable options. In this case, the Edit button will be disabled.</li></ul><p>Once you’ve made your selections and clicked Export to begin the rendering process, audio rendering will begin. After the audio rendering is complete, the video will be rendered. Note that, depending on the encoder used, video rendering may occur in more than one pass. Live will display a progress bar that will indicate the status of the process.</p><p>Unless you’ve specified a special window size or aspect ratio in the encoder settings, the rendered video file will play back exactly as it appeared during real time playback in Live. The video file will also contain the rendered audio.</p><p>For more information about working with video in Live, see the chapter on video (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-video/#working-with-video">‘Working with Video’</a>).</p></section><section id="real-time-rendering" data-number="1.1.3.5"><h4 data-number="4.1.3.5"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3.5</span> Real-Time Rendering</h4><p>Normally, rendering happens as an offline process. But if your set contains an External Audio Effect (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#external-audio-effect">‘External Audio Effect’</a>) or External Instrument (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#external-instrument">‘External Instrument’</a>) that routes to a hardware effects device or synthesizer, the rendering process is a bit different. In this case, rendering the Main output happens in real time. If you render single tracks, all tracks that don’t route to an external device anywhere in their signal paths will be rendered offline. Then, any tracks that do access these devices will be rendered in real time. Live will automatically trace each track’s signal flow and detect if real-time rendering is necessary. You’ll then be presented with several options when you start to render:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RenderRealTimeWaiting.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Waiting for External Devices to Become Silent.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Skip</em> — By default, Live will wait for ten seconds before starting a real-time render. This should allow any sound from external devices to fade out, but if you need more time (for example, if you’re waiting for a long reverb tail), you can increase the wait time by typing a new number in the number box. On the other hand, if you’re sure that your external devices aren’t making any sound, you can speed the process along by pressing “Skip,“ which will start the render immediately.</li></ul><p>After the render has begun, the dialog changes to show a recording progress bar:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RenderRealTimeRecording.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Real-Time Rendering in Progress.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Auto-Restart on drop-outs</em> — Rendering in real-time requires somewhat more CPU power than non-real-time rendering, and in some cases drop-outs (small gaps or glitches in the audio) can occur. Live detects when drop-outs happen, and rendering will start again from the beginning if the Auto-Restart option is enabled.</li><li><em>Restart</em> — manually restarts the rendering process.</li><li><em>Cancel</em> — stops the rendering process and deletes the partially rendered file.</li></ul><p>The number of rendering attempts (if there has been more than one) will also be listed in the dialog box. If you find that dropouts and restarts keep happening, you should close other running applications to allow more processing power for rendering.

MIDI files are exported by hardware and software MIDI sequencers. Importing MIDI files into Live works differently than with samples: MIDI file data is incorporated into the Live Set, and the resulting MIDI clips lose all reference to the original file. MIDI files appear with a special icon in the browser.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MIDIFileInBrowser.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A MIDI File in the Browser.</figcaption></figure><p>You can import MIDI files by using the browser or the Create menu’s Import MIDI File… command.

Audio clips only contain references to samples on disk (rather than the audio data itself), so they are very small, which makes it easy to develop and maintain your own collection.</p><p>To save a clip from the open Live Set to disk, simply drag it to the Places section of the browser and drop it into the Current Project or any user folder. For audio clips, Live will manage the copying of the clip’s sample into this new location based on the selection in the Collect Files on Export chooser (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#collect-files-on-export">‘Collect Files on Export’</a>). You can then type in a new name for the clip or confirm the one suggested by Live with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/LiveClipInBrowser.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Live Clip in the Browser.</figcaption></figure><p>Live Clips are a great way of storing your ideas for later use or development, as they save not only the original clip, including all its clip and envelope settings, but also the original track’s devices. In order to recreate a Live Clip’s device chain, either drag it into a track containing no clips or devices, or drag it into the space in the Session or Arrangement View containing no tracks. Note that Live Clips that are imported into tracks already containing devices or clips will appear with their clip settings but not their devices. You could, for instance, drop a bassline Live Clip on an existing track that drives a bass instrument, rather than creating a new track.</p><p>Clips belonging to any Live Sets already on disk are also Live Clips. Please see the section on merging Sets (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#merging-sets">‘Merging Sets’</a>) for more on this topic.</p><p>Note that storing default clip settings with a sample’s analysis file is different from saving a Live Clip. The default clip in the .asd file annotates the sample with sensible default values (warp, gain and pitch settings) so that it will play in a defined way when it is added to a set. Live Clips, on the other hand, are stored on disk as separate musical ideas. For example, you could create a number of variations from the same audio clip by using different warp, pitch, envelope and effect settings, and store them all as separate Live Clips. In the browser, you could then independently sort and preview these clips, even though they are all referring to the same source sample.</p></section><section id="live-sets" data-number="1.4"><h2 data-number="4.4"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Live Sets</h2><p>The type of document that you create and work on in Live is called a <em>Live Set</em>.

Perhaps you also save Live Clips or device presets that “belong“ to this particular musical piece. The project folder for this Live Project will maintain all the files related to this piece of music — and Live’s <em>File Manager</em> will provide the tools you need to manage them (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#managing-files-in-a-project">‘Managing Files in a Project’</a>).</p><section id="projects-and-live-sets" data-number="1.5.1"><h3 data-number="4.5.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Projects and Live Sets</h3><p>When you save a Live Set under a new name or in a new folder location, Live will create a new project folder and store the Live Set there — unless you are saving the Live Set into an existing Live Project. Let’s look at an example to illustrate this process:</p><p>We have recorded some audio into a new Live Set. We now save the Live Set under the name “Tango“ on the Desktop. The Desktop is available in the browser because we have previously added it as a user folder. Here is the result as displayed by the Live browser:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ProjectTangoInLiveBrowser.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Live Set and its Recordings in a Live Project Folder.</figcaption></figure><p>The project folder (“Tango Project“) contains the Live Set (“Tango.als“) and a Samples folder, which in turn contains a Recorded folder with two samples in it. Note that the current Project is also indicated in the title bar of Live’s application window.</p><p>Next, we record another track into our Project. We save the modified version of the Live Set under a new name so that we do not lose the previous version. Accepting the Save As command’s default suggestion, we store the new version of the song in the Tango Project folder.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ProjectTangoWithPiano.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Second Version of the Live Set Has Been Added to the Project.</figcaption></figure><p>The Tango Project now contains two Live Sets, and its Samples/Recorded folder contains the samples used by both of them.</p><p>And now for something completely different: We choose the File menu’s New Live Set command and record a samba tune. As this has nothing to do with our tango dabblings, we decide to save it outside the Tango Project folder, say on the Desktop. Live creates a new project folder named Samba Project next to Tango Project.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ProjectSamba.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A New Project Was Added Next to Tango Project.</figcaption></figure><p>So far we have seen how to create Live Projects and save versions of Live Sets into them. How do we open a Project? Simply by opening any of its contained Live Sets. Double-clicking “Tango with Piano.als“ opens that Set and the associated Project — as displayed in Live’s title bar.</p><p>Let’s suppose that, in the course of our work on “Tango with Piano.als,“ we get sidetracked: The piece evolves towards something entirely different, and we feel that it should live in a Project of its own. So, we “Save As…“ under a new name and in some location outside the current Project, say the Desktop:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ProjectElectroWithPiano.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A New Project Was Added by Saving a Live Set Outside its Original Project.</figcaption></figure><p>Note that the new project folder has no Samples folder (yet). “Electro with Piano.als“ is still referencing the piano sample from the original Tango Project. There is nothing wrong with this except for when the Tango Project is moved away or deleted; then “Electro with Piano.als“ will be missing samples. You can prevent this by collecting external files (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#collecting-external-files">‘Collecting External Files’</a>). Even after the fact, Live’s tools for searching missing files (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#locating-missing-files">‘Locating Missing Files’</a>) can help solve this problem.</p><p>There is actually no need to keep a Project’s Live Set exactly one level below the Project itself. Within a project folder, you can create any number of sub-folders and move files around to organize them as desired, although you many need to use the File Manager to “teach“ the Project about the changes you’ve made (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#how-can-i-save-presets-into-my-current-project">‘How Can I Save Presets Into My Current Project?’</a>).</p><p>In general, Live will do what it can to prevent situations such as orphaned (Project-less) Live Sets, which have the potential of confusing both the user and Live’s file management tools. It cannot, however, control situations in which Sets or files are moved out of order and become disorganized via the Explorer (Windows)/Finder (Mac).</p><p><em>A note for users of older Live versions</em>: Live does not allow overwriting Live Sets that were created by older major versions to prevent compatibility problems. Instead, you will be requested to “Save As…“. Doing this will insure that the newly saved Live Sets reside in project folders.</p></section><section id="projects-and-presets" data-number="1.5.2"><h3 data-number="4.5.2"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Projects and Presets</h3><p>By default, new instrument and effect presets are stored in your current Project.

With this mode enabled, samples can be transposed roughly 19 semitones in either direction before aliasing is likely to be audible.</p><p>From Live 7 on, the Hi-Q mode uses an algorithm that produces even smaller audible artifacts than in previous versions. Although we think this has greatly improved sound quality, any Sets made in older versions that used Hi-Q mode may now sound different.

The new sample can be found, after saving the Live Set, in the Set’s Project folder, under Samples/Processed/Reverse. Until the Set is saved, new samples remain at the location specified by the Temporary Folder.</p><p>There are a few rules for the reversing process. First, any Warp Markers will remain fixed to their positions <em>in the sample</em>. This means that a Warp Marker on the downbeat of the second bar of a clip will end up on the downbeat of the second-to-last bar after reversal. Clip loop/region settings are similarly flipped. Second, clip envelopes remain fixed to their position <em>in time</em>. Therefore, a mixer volume envelope that lowers the volume of the first half of a clip will continue to do exactly that after reversal.</p><p>The reversal process is quite fast (about as fast as copying), but for very long samples it might take a little time. When this is the case, the Status Bar in the lower portion of the Live screen will give you a progress display, and further actions in the program will be temporarily locked (though running clips will continue to play). You can play the reversed clip and perform other actions in the program as soon as Live begins to draw the new waveform into the Sample Editor. Once a sample is reversed, a link to the reversed sample will be maintained until you quit the program, and reversing the same clip again (or a copy) will be instantaneous.</p><p>In the Arrangement View, it is possible to reverse a selection of material, even if it contains multiple clips. To do this, select the range of time you want to reverse, and choose the Reverse Clip(s) command from the clip’s <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu, or press the <kbd>R</kbd> shortcut key.</p><p>It is not recommended that you reverse clips in a live performance situation, as a slight audio glitch can sometimes occur while Live reapplies the warp and loop settings.</p></section><section id="cropping-audio-clips" data-number="1.2.8"><h3 data-number="7.2.8"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.8</span> Cropping Audio Clips</h3><p>The Sample Editor’s <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu includes the Crop Sample command.

Live is capable of <em>time-warping</em> samples while streaming them from disk so as to synchronize them to the current Live Set’s tempo. This happens without affecting the pitch, which can be changed independently. Mixing and matching audio from different origins is therefore extremely easy.</p><section id="tempo" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="8.1"><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Tempo</h2><section id="setting-the-tempo" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="8.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">8.1.1</span> Setting the Tempo</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TempoControl.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Control Bar’s Tempo Field.</figcaption></figure><p>The Control Bar’s Tempo field allows you to change the playback tempo of your Live Set at any time, in real time. You can even automate the tempo (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/automation-and-editing-envelopes/#editing-the-tempo-automation">‘Editing the Tempo Automation’</a>) to create smooth or sudden tempo changes along the song timeline. For maximum tempo control during performance, you can MIDI map (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/midi-and-key-remote-control/#midi-and-key-remote-control">‘MIDI and Key Remote Control’</a>) separate controllers to the Tempo field on both sides of the decimal point. Setting one knob to control coarse tempo in BPM and another to control fine tempo in hundredths of a BPM allows for enough precision to adjust to live performers or other unsynchronized sources.</p><p>You can have an external sequencer (or drum machine) play along with Live or have Live play along with the sequencer. The respective settings are made in the Link, Tempo &amp; MIDI Preferences. Please refer to the chapter on synchronization (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi/#synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi">‘Synchronizing with Link, Tempo Follower, and MIDI’</a>) for details.</p></section><section id="tapping-the-tempo" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="8.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">8.1.2</span> Tapping the Tempo</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TapButton.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Tap Button.</figcaption></figure><p>You can use Live’s Tap Tempo function to set the tempo at any time.

Click on the Control Bar’s KEY switch to enter Key Map Mode; then select the Tap button; press the key you would like to use for tapping; click the KEY switch again to leave Key Map Mode. The assignment will take effect immediately. The Tap button can also be assigned to a MIDI note or controller, like a foot switch, in a similar fashion. Although Live responds to your tapping immediately, it does apply some degree of inertia to prevent sluggish behavior in the software. The more taps Live receives in a row, the more precisely it will be able to conclude the desired tempo.</p><p>If the “Start Playback with Tap Tempo” button is enabled in Live’s Record, Warp &amp; Launch Preferences, you can also use tapping to count in: If you are working in a 4:4 signature, it takes four taps to start song playback at the tapped tempo. Starting playback of Live’s transport by tapping the tempo will automatically adjust the playback position of any apps that are connected via Ableton Link (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi/#setting-up-link">‘Setting up Link’</a>). This ensures that those apps remain tempo synced, and also at the correct position in the musical phrase.</p></section><section id="nudging-the-tempo" data-number="1.1.3"><h3 data-number="8.1.3"><span class="header-section-number">8.1.3</span> Nudging the Tempo</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TempoNudge.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Phase Nudge Up/Down Buttons.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Live can be easily synchronized via Link or to external MIDI devices (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi/#synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi">‘Synchronizing with Link, Tempo Follower, and MIDI’</a>), you may find yourself in situations in which you need to adjust to sources that aren’t locked to one tempo, such as live musicians or turntables. As long as your Set’s tempo is basically the same as that of the unsynchronized material, you can use the Phase Nudge Up/Down buttons to temporarily speed up or slow down Live’s playback to match what you hear. As with the Tap button, these buttons are much easier to use when mapped to MIDI controllers.</p></section></section><section id="time-warping-samples" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="8.2"><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Time-Warping Samples</h2><p>Live’s ability to play any sample in sync with a chosen tempo is a unique and important feature. In addition, you can “warp“ the rhythmic flow of a piece, changing its “feel,“ or even move notes to other meter positions.</p><p>An audio clip’s warping properties are set in the Audio tab/panel (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-view/#the-audio-tab-panel">‘The Audio Tab/Panel’</a>), which is a sub-section of the Clip View.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AudioClipWarpControls.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Audio Tab’s Warping Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>The most significant control here is the <em>Warp</em> switch, which toggles an audio clip’s warping on or off. The Warp section of Live’s Preferences will determine the default warp settings for new clips, but they can always be overridden here on a per-clip basis.</p><p>When the Warp switch is off, Live plays the sample at its original, “normal“ tempo, irrespective of the current Live Set’s tempo. This is useful for samples that have no inherent rhythmic structure: percussion hits, atmospheres, sound effects, spoken word and the like. Turn the Warp switch on to play rhythmically structured samples (such as sample loops, music recordings, complete music pieces, etc.) in sync with the current song tempo.</p><p>To direct Live’s assumptions about new samples, use the Record/Warp/Launch tab of Live’s Preferences. If the Auto-Warp Long Samples preference is on, Live assumes that long samples contain music that should be played in sync with the Live Set’s tempo. If you would rather have Live default to playing long samples as they are, disengage this preference.</p><section id="tempo-leaderfollower" data-number="1.2.1"><h3 data-number="8.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> Tempo Leader/Follower</h3><p>All warped clips in the Arrangement View have one further option: They can be defined as <em>tempo leaders</em> by toggling their Leader/Follower switches. Any number of clips can be set as <em>tempo leaders</em>, but only one clip at a time can actually <em>be</em> the tempo leader. This distinction is always granted to the bottom-most, currently playing clip in the Arrangement View.</p><p>The clip that is the current tempo leader will play as if warping was <em>off</em>, but with one important difference — the rest of the Live Set will be warped so that it plays in sync with the current tempo leader.</p><p>This is achieved by adding tempo automation to the Main track for the duration of the tempo leader clip. You will notice that the Tempo field in Live’s Control Bar becomes disabled in this state; this is because all tempo control is handed over to the tempo leader clip.</p><p>When toggling a clip’s Leader/Follower switch, or when deleting a clip that was set as tempo leader, the Main track tempo automation is removed again, restoring the proper tempo to the region. If you wish instead to <em>keep</em> the generated tempo automation to continue working with it, then <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) on the Control Bar’s Tempo field, and choose the Unfollow Tempo Automation command. All clips will then be set to Follower, but the tempo automation will remain in place.</p><p>Note that when Live’s EXT switch is enabled (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi/#synchronizing-external-midi-devices-to-live">‘Synchronizing External MIDI Devices to Live’</a>), the Leader/Follower switch has no effect and appears disabled).</p></section><section id="warp-markers" data-number="1.2.2"><h3 data-number="8.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.2</span> Warp Markers</h3><p>Think of a sample as a rubber-band that you want to pin to a (musical time) ruler. In Live, the pins are called <em>Warp Markers</em>. A Warp Marker locks a specific point in the sample to a specific place in the measure. You can use any number of Warp Markers to create an arbitrary mapping of the piece’s inherent rhythm to a musical meter.</p><p>Warp Markers are set in the Clip View’s Sample Editor by double-clicking in the upper half of the sample. They can then be dragged or moved with the arrow keys to different points in time. Warp Markers can also be deleted by double-clicking them, or by pressing the computer keyboard’s <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> key after selecting them.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/WarpMarker.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Double-Clicking In the Sample Creates a Warp Marker.</figcaption></figure><p>When working with your clip, you can have Live scroll the Sample Editor to follow playback.

These are the points in the audio where notes or events begin, and are usually good places to put Warp Markers. Transients appear as small markers at the top of the Sample Editor after zooming in.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Transients.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Transient Markers.</figcaption></figure><p>As you mouse over transients, temporary “pseudo“ Warp Markers appear. These have the same shape as regular Warp Markers, but they’re gray. Double-clicking or dragging a pseudo Warp Marker creates an actual Warp Marker or, if there are no Warp Markers later in the clip, changes the tempo for the clip segment. Holding the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) modifier while creating a Warp Marker on a transient also creates Warp Markers at the adjacent transients. Holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier while clicking on a pseudo Warp Marker allows you to drag the transient to a new position. Once a Warp Marker has been created, holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging the Warp Marker will move the waveform beneath the marker, rather than the marker itself.</p><p>You can also select a range of time and create Warp Markers at all of the transients within the range via the Create menu’s “Insert Warp Markers“ command. If there are no transients within your time selection, a Warp Marker will be created at the end of the selection.</p><p>Although Live usually does a good job of placing transients in the right places, you can delete and create transients as well, via the corresponding commands in the Create menu.</p></section><section id="saving-warp-markers" data-number="1.2.2.2"><h4 data-number="8.2.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.2.2</span> Saving Warp Markers</h4><p>Your Warp Markers will automatically be saved with the Live Set, but you may also want to save them with the sample file itself, so that they are reconstructed anytime you drag the file into Live.

It creates two Warp Markers, one at the sample’s beginning and one at the end.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TwoBarLoopInClipView.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Two-Bar Loop as It Appears in the Clip View, by Default.</figcaption></figure><p>The Seg.

If so, correct this by clicking on the buttons labeled ×2 and ÷2, respectively. The sample plays at double speed when you press ÷2 because you are changing Live’s interpretation of the sample’s tempo, which serves as a point of reference for determining the required time-stretch factor.</p><p>Note that it’s possible to fine-tune the Seg.

Suppose there is a portion of silence at the sample beginning, prior to the first beat. You can easily correct this by placing a Warp Marker at the beginning of the audio and dragging it so that it lines up with the beginning of bar one in the timeline. Likewise, you can eliminate silence after the actual loop end by placing a Warp Marker at the sample’s right edge.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/UnCutLoopCorrected.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Setting the Warp Markers for a Poorly Cut Loop.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="syncing-odd-length-loops" data-number="1.2.3.3"><h4 data-number="8.2.3.3"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.3.3</span> Syncing Odd-Length Loops</h4><p>If you import a sample that contains a seven-bar loop, Live initially assumes the loop is eight bars long (or four, depending on its length) and plays it out of sync. For correct playback, the marker at the end of the sample needs to be at the beginning of bar eight, not bar nine. To fix this, simply drag the ending marker to the correct position.</p><p>If Live’s initial guess had been a four-bar loop, the eighth bar may not initially be visible. In that case, you can drag the Warp Marker at the end toward the right until the eight becomes visible.</p></section><section id="manipulating-grooves" data-number="1.2.3.4"><h4 data-number="8.2.3.4"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.3.4</span> Manipulating Grooves</h4><p>You can now create any number of Warp Markers by double-clicking within the clip or on transient locations.

You can use the browser or the Create menu’s Import Audio File… command to import long samples or MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, Ogg FLAC and FLAC files. (Please note that not all of these file formats can be played in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</p><p>Note that when using the Import Audio File… command in the Arrangement View, the file will be inserted at the Insert Marker position. When using the command in the Session View, the file will be inserted in the currently selected clip slot.</p><p>When you drag an audio file into Live that is too long to justify the assumption that it is a loop or a one-shot, Live will auto-warp the clip by default (though this can be changed in the Record, Warp &amp; Launch Preferences).</p><p>Note that, for the auto-warp mechanism to work, files which are being imported into the program for the first time will need to undergo a first-time analysis process and will not be immediately available for playing or editing.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AutoWarpedClip.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Auto-Warp’s Results in the Clip View.</figcaption></figure><p>As long as Auto-Warp made the correct set of informed guesses, the clip will be ready to play in perfect sync with the Live Set’s tempo. However, if Auto-Warp does not quite do what you want, you can control its results. The remainder of this section will focus on various ways of guiding Live’s auto-warping. Remember that the metronome in the Control Bar will probably come in handy as you warp longer pieces.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Metronome.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Metronome Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>It might happen that Auto-Warp guesses the tempo correctly but gets the downbeat wrong. To remedy this, you can do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while dragging the first Warp Marker. This will allow you to adjust the position of the waveform under the Warp Marker.</li><li>Zoom in and create a Warp Marker on the downbeat. Then drag it to the beginning of bar 1 in the timeline;</li><li>Use the start marker’s <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu to select the <em>Set 1.1.1 Here</em> command.</li></ul><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/GridMarkerContextMenu.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Using the Context Menu to Direct Auto-Warp.</figcaption></figure><p>Directing Auto-Warp is also relatively simple when you have imported a perfectly cut loop. You can tell Auto-Warp to work accordingly using the <em>Warp Sample As …-Bar/Beat Loop</em> command. Live will propose a loop length that makes the most sense given the current Live Set’s tempo. Decreasing the Live Set’s tempo can, for instance, lead Live to assume the loop is 8 bars at 90 BPM instead of 16 bars at 180 BPM.</p><p>You can also direct Auto-Warp to work on a selected portion of a sample. This is useful if, for example, you’d like to warp and loop an isolated breakbeat from a full song. To do this, first drag in the background of the sample editor to select the part of the sample you’d like to warp. Then use the <em>Warp Selection As …-Bar/Beat Loop</em> command. Live will make its best guess about the correct loop length, set the loop markers to match, and then warp the selection so that it fits in this time.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/WarpSelectionAs.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Warping a Selected Portion of a Sample.</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes more accurate control of Auto-Warp is necessary. The best way to go about warping a clip that requires more detailed attention is in sections, working gradually from left to right. You can set a Warp Marker by double-clicking in the sample to the right of each correctly warped section, “pinning“ it into place. The shortcuts for working with the clip loop brace and start/end markers can speed up this process considerably (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-view/#clip-gain-and-pitch">‘Clip Gain and Pitch’</a>).</p><p>You might also find it helpful to select multiple Warp Markers for moving by selecting them with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) modifiers held down.</p><p>The four Warp From Here commands provide various ways of resetting Warp Markers to the right of the selected grid marker or Warp Marker, leaving Warp Markers to the left untouched. These commands are also available from the start marker.</p><ul><li><em>Warp From Here</em> runs the Auto-Warp algorithm on the material to the right of the selected marker.</li><li><em>Warp From Here (Start At …)</em> directs Auto-Warp to use the current Live Set’s tempo as a starting point for tempo tracking. The strategy here is as follows:</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>Deactivate the Warp switch for the clip so that it plays unwarped;</li><li>Use the Control Bar’s Tap Tempo button to tap along, thereby setting the Live Set’s tempo to match that of the clip;</li></ol><p>Turn warping on again and use the Warp From Here (Start At …) command to tell Auto-Warp to use your tapped tempo as a reference.</p><ul><li><em>Warp From Here (Straight)</em> tells Auto-Warp that this is a clip with no tempo variations (common in electronically produced works). Auto-Warp will then set a single Warp Marker derived from its guess of the file’s original tempo.</li><li><em>Warp … BPM From Here</em> will also set a single Warp Marker, but in this case, Auto-Warp is forced to interpret the clip as exactly matching the Live Set’s tempo. This is useful in cases when you happen to know the exact BPM value of an electronically-produced work and can type it into the Control Bar before warping.</li></ul></section><section id="multi-clip-warping" data-number="1.2.3.6"><h4 data-number="8.2.3.6"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.3.6</span> Multi-Clip Warping</h4><p>When clips of equal length are multi-selected, adding or changing Warp Markers for one clip will apply identical Warp Markers to all. This is convenient in any situation where several tracks have the same rhythm, and you wish to alter the timing of each recording in the same way. A common scenario would be when multi-tracking a band’s performance, where the musicians all play in time with each other, yet the timing itself is in some way flawed.</p></section></section><section id="quantizing-audio" data-number="1.2.4"><h3 data-number="8.2.4"><span class="header-section-number">8.2.4</span> Quantizing Audio</h3><p>In the previous section, you learned how to adjust the timing of events in audio files by manually dragging Warp Markers along the timeline. But it is also possible to automatically snap the entire sample to the grid at once by using the Quantize command. To do this, click in the background of the sample editor and choose the Quantize command from the Edit menu, or use the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) hotkey. This will quantize using default settings, or the settings that you previously applied.</p><p>To adjust your quantization parameters, navigate to the Transform tab/panel to use the Quantize tool.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/QuantizeAudio.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Quantizing Audio Samples.</figcaption></figure><p>Using the options presented here, you can select either the current grid size or a specific meter value for quantization (including triplets).

Each clip’s time-stretching mode and associated parameters are set in the Clip View’s <em>Audio tab/panel</em>.</p><p>The warp modes are different varieties of granular resynthesis techniques. Granular resynthesis achieves time compression and expansion by repeating and skipping over parts of the sample (the “grains“). The warp modes differ in the selection of grains, as well as in the details of overlapping and crossfading between grains.</p><p>Let’s investigate which warp modes work best for different types of signals and how to adjust the warping controls for “clean“ stretching. It’s also fun to “misuse“ these controls to achieve interesting artifacts instead of accurate stretching.</p><section id="beats-mode" data-number="1.3.1"><h3 data-number="8.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">8.3.1</span> Beats Mode</h3><p>Beats Mode works best for material where rhythm is dominant (e.g., drum loops as well as most pieces of electronic dance music). The granulation process is optimized to preserve transients in the audio material.</p><p>Use the <em>Preserve</em> control to preserve divisions in the sample as boundaries when warping. For the most accurate results, particularly with percussive material, choose Transients. This setting uses the positions of the analyzed (or user-created) transients to determine warping behavior. To preserve specific beat divisions regardless of the sample’s contents, choose one of the fixed note values. For some interesting rhythmic artifacts, choose large note values in conjunction with pitch transposition.</p><p>The Transient Loop Mode chooser sets the looping properties for the clip’s transients:</p><p><span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SamplerLoopNo.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=21"></span><em>Loop Off</em> — Each segment of audio between transients plays to its end and then stops. Any remaining time between the end of a segment and the next transient will be silent.</p><p><span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SamplerLoopEnabled.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=21"></span><em>Loop Forward</em> — Each segment of audio between transients plays to its end. Playback then jumps back to a zero-crossing near the middle of the segment and continues looping until the time when the next transient occurs.</p><p><span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SamplerLoopBack.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=21"></span><em>Loop Back-and-Forth</em> — Each segment of audio between transients plays to its end. Playback then reverses until it reaches a zero-crossing near the middle of the segment, and then proceeds again towards the end of the segment. This pattern continues until the time when the next transient occurs. This mode, in conjunction with the Preserve Transients selection, can often result in very good quality at slower tempos.</p><p>The Transient Envelope slider applies a volume fade to each segment of audio. At 100, there is no fade. At 0, each segment decays very quickly. Long envelope times can help to smooth clicks at the end of segments, while short times can be used to apply rhythmic gating effects.</p></section><section id="tones-mode" data-number="1.3.2"><h3 data-number="8.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">8.3.2</span> Tones Mode</h3><p>Tones Mode serves well for stretching material with a more or less clear pitch structure, such as vocals, monophonic instruments and basslines.</p><p><em>Grain Size</em> provides rough control over the average grain size used. The actual grain size is determined in a signal-dependent manner. For signals with a clear sense of pitch contour, a small grain size works best. Larger grain sizes help avoid artifacts that can occur when the pitch contour is unclear, but the trade-off can be audible repetitions.</p></section><section id="texture-mode" data-number="1.3.3"><h3 data-number="8.3.3"><span class="header-section-number">8.3.3</span> Texture Mode</h3><p>Texture Mode works well for sound textures with an ambiguous pitch contour (e.g., polyphonic orchestral music, noise, atmospheric pads, etc.). It also offers rich potential for manipulating all kinds of sounds in a creative way.</p><p>The <em>Grain Size</em> control determines the grain size used, but unlike in Tones Mode, this is a setting that Live will use unaltered, without considering the signal’s characteristics.</p><p><em>Fluctuation</em> introduces randomness into the process. Larger values give more randomness.</p></section><section id="re-pitch-mode" data-number="1.3.4"><h3 data-number="8.3.4"><span class="header-section-number">8.3.4</span> Re-Pitch Mode</h3><p>In Re-Pitch Mode, Live doesn’t really time-stretch or compress the music; instead, it adjusts the playback rate to create the desired amount of stretching. In other words, to speed up playback by a factor of 2, it’s transposed up an octave. This is like the “DJ stretching method“ of using variable-speed turntables to sync two records, or what happens to samples in traditional samplers when they’re transposed.</p><p>The Transpose and Detune controls have no effect in Re-Pitch Mode.</p></section><section id="complex-mode" data-number="1.3.5"><h3 data-number="8.3.5"><span class="header-section-number">8.3.5</span> Complex Mode</h3><p>Complex Mode is a warping method specifically designed to accommodate composite signals that combine the characteristics covered by other Warp Modes; it works well for warping entire songs, which usually contain beats, tones and textures.</p><p>Complex Mode is a rather CPU-intensive function, using approximately ten times the CPU resources required by the other Warp Modes. As such, you may want to freeze tracks (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/computer-audio-resources-and-strategies/#track-freeze">‘Track Freeze’</a>) where Complex Mode is used or record (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/recording-new-clips/#recording-new-clips">‘Recording New Clips’</a>) the results as a new clip to use as a substitute.</p></section><section id="complex-pro-mode" data-number="1.3.6"><h3 data-number="8.3.6"><span class="header-section-number">8.3.6</span> Complex Pro Mode</h3><p>Complex Pro Mode uses a variation of the algorithm found in Complex mode, and may offer even better results (although with an increase in CPU usage.) Like Complex Mode, Complex Pro works especially well with polyphonic textures or whole songs.</p><p>The <em>Formants</em> slider adjusts the extent to which the formants of the sample are compensated when transposing. At 100%, the original formants will be preserved, which allows for large changes in transposition while maintaining the sample’s original tonal quality. Note that this slider has no effect if the sample is played back untransposed.</p><p>The <em>Envelope</em> slider also influences the spectral characteristics of the material. The default setting of 128 should work well for most audio. For very high-pitched samples, you may have better results with lower Envelope values. Likewise, low-pitched material may sound better with higher values.</p></section><section id="rex-mode" data-number="1.3.7"><h3 data-number="8.3.7"><span class="header-section-number">8.3.7</span> REX Mode</h3><p>REX Mode differs from the other Warp modes in several ways. Most notably, it is not available as an option in the Clip View’s Audio tab/panel, but is instead enabled automatically when loading a file in REX format. REX files, associated with the program ReCycle by Propellerhead Software, contain embedded tempo and timing information and will synchronize to your Set’s tempo just like any other audio file.</p><p>Although REX files are audio files, they can quickly be transformed into playable instruments via the Slice to New MIDI Track command (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/converting-audio-to-midi/#slice-to-new-midi-track">‘Slice to New MIDI Track’</a>), which is available in the Create Menu or the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu for the clip.</p><p>Warp Markers/parameters, Clip Envelopes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-envelopes/#clip-envelopes">‘Clip Envelopes’</a>) that affect warping properties, and the Clip Nudge (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/launching-clips/#clip-offset-and-nudging">‘Clip Offset and Nudging’</a>) controls are not available for REX files.</p><p>Please note that REX file support is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.</p></section></section></section></div>

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to toggle the selection between the timespan and any notes that begin within it.</li></ul><p>After placing the insert marker, you can manipulate it using your computer keyboard.</p><ul><li>Press the left or right arrow keys to move the insert marker to the left or right, according to the grid settings. <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) plus the left or right arrow keys moves the insert marker to the next note boundary.</li><li>Hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while pressing the arrow keys to extend or retract the selected timespan by moving the insert marker. <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) plus <kbd>Shift</kbd> while pressing the arrow keys extends or retracts from the opposite side of the selection.</li><li>The insert marker can be moved to the beginning or end of a MIDI clip by pressing the <kbd>Home</kbd> or <kbd>End</kbd> key, respectively.</li></ul><p>As we have seen, notes in the MIDI Note Editor can be moved both horizontally (changing their position in time) and vertically (changing their transposition). They can be moved either by clicking and dragging, or with the arrow keys on your computer keyboard. Notes moved with the arrow keys are always subject to grid and offset snapping, while notes dragged with the mouse can be freely moved until reaching the previous or next grid or offset point. If you are playing the clip while you edit notes, you can listen to them play in their new assignments as you change them.</p><p>Several key modifiers also apply to note editing:</p><ul><li>To transpose selected notes by octave, hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while pressing the up or down arrow keys.</li><li><kbd>Shift</kbd> plus the left or right arrow keys extends or retracts the duration of selected notes, according to the grid settings. To extend or retract notes without snapping to the grid, also hold <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac).</li><li>To change the selection to the next note in the same key track, hold <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) while pressing the left or right arrow keys. <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) plus the up or down arrow keys moves the selection to the next note in time.</li><li>To nudge notes without snapping to the grid, hold <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) and press the left or right arrow keys.</li><li>You can use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier to click and add individual notes or additional “rubber-band” selections to your current selection. You can also remove a single note from your selection by holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd> and clicking on it. Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and clicking on the piano roll adds all notes in a single key track to the current selection, or removes them if they were already selected.</li></ul><p>Selecting a note (or notes) makes it subject to commands from the Edit menu, such as Copy and Paste. Notes in the clipboard will be pasted starting at the location of the insert marker. You can also use the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) modifier to click and drag copies of notes to a new location. If you click and drag to move notes but then decide that you would like to copy them instead, you can press the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) modifier even after starting the drag.</p><p>When editing or drawing, you may sometimes place a new note on top of one that already exists. If the new note overlaps with the beginning of the original note, the original note will vanish. If the new note overlaps with the “tail” of the original, the original note’s length will change so that it lasts just until the new note’s beginning.</p></section><section id="changing-note-length" data-number="1.4.5"><h3 data-number="9.4.5"><span class="header-section-number">9.4.5</span> Changing Note Length</h3><p>Clicking and dragging on a note’s left or right edges changes its length.

Slicing differs from the Convert commands below, in that it doesn’t analyze the <em>musical</em> context of your original audio. Instead, it simply splits the original audio into portions of time, regardless of the content. The Drum Rack (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/instrument-drum-and-effect-racks/#drum-racks">‘Drum Racks’</a>) provides an ideal environment for working with sliced files, and most of the setup happens automatically after you make a few choices:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SlicingDialog.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Slicing Dialog.</figcaption></figure><p>When you select Slice to New MIDI track, you’ll be presented with a dialog box. This offers a list of slicing divisions, as well as a chooser to select the Slicing Preset. The top chooser allows you to slice at a variety of beat resolutions or according to the clip’s transients or Warp Markers. Since a Rack can contain a maximum of 128 chains, Live won’t let you proceed if your choice would result in more than 128 slices. You can fix this by either setting a lower slice resolution or by selecting a smaller region of the clip to slice. If your audio file is in REX format (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#rex-mode">‘REX Mode’</a>), the slicing will be based on the file’s internal timing information and you won’t see this chooser.</p><p>The Slicing Preset chooser contains a few Ableton-supplied slicing templates, as well as any of your own that you may have placed in your User Library’s default presets folder (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#default-presets">‘Default Presets’</a>).</p><p>With “Preserve warped timing” enabled, the clip will be sliced in such a way that timing alterations as a result of warping are preserved. With this option disabled, any changes that result from warping will not be reflected in the sliced clip; the sliced version will instead sound like the original, “raw” audio.</p><p>Once you’ve made your slicing choices and clicked OK, a number of things will happen:</p><ol type="1"><li>A new MIDI track will be created, containing a MIDI clip. The clip will contain one note for each slice, arranged in a chromatic sequence.</li><li>A Drum Rack will be added to the newly created track, containing one chain per slice. Each chain will be triggered by one of the notes from the clip, and will contain a Simpler with the corresponding audio slice loaded.</li><li>The Drum Rack’s Macro Controls will be pre-assigned to useful parameters for the Simplers, as determined by the settings in the selected slicing preset. In the factory Slicing presets, these include basic envelope controls and parameters to adjust the loop and crossfade properties of each slice. Adjusting one of these Macros will adjust the mapped parameter in each Simpler simultaneously.</li></ol><p>Note: Live will take a few moments to process all of this information.</p><p>Playing the MIDI clip will trigger each chain in the Drum Rack in order, according to the timing information that you specified or that was embedded in the audio. This opens up many new editing possibilities, including:</p><section id="resequencing-slices" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="12.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.1</span> Resequencing Slices</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SlicingMIDIEditing.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Rearranging the Sliced MIDI Data.</figcaption></figure><p>By default, your sliced MIDI data will form a chromatically-ascending “staircase“ pattern in order to trigger the correct chains in their original order. But you can create new patterns by simply editing the MIDI notes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/editing-midi-notes-and-velocities/#editing-midi">‘Editing MIDI’</a>). You can achieve a similar effect by dragging the Drum Rack’s pads onto each other to swap their note mappings.</p></section><section id="using-effects-on-slices" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="12.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.2</span> Using Effects on Slices</h3><p>Because each slice lives in its own chain in the Drum Rack, you can easily process individual slices with their own audio effects. To process several slices with the same set of effects, multi-select their chains in the Drum Rack’s chain list and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>(Mac) to group them to their own nested Rack. Then insert the effects after this new sub-Rack.</p><p>For even more creative possibilities, try inserting MIDI effects (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-midi-effect-reference/#live-midi-effect-reference">‘Live MIDI Effect Reference’</a>) before the Drum Rack. The Arpeggiator and Random devices can yield particularly interesting results.</p><p>Slicing is most commonly applied to drum loops, but there’s no reason to stop there. Experiment with slicing audio from different sources, such as voices and ambient textures. The same sorts of resequencing and reprocessing operations can be applied to anything you slice — sometimes with unexpected results.</p></section></section><section id="convert-harmony-to-new-midi-track" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="12.2"><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Convert Harmony to New MIDI Track</h2><p>This command identifies the pitches in a polyphonic audio recording and places them into a clip on a new MIDI track.

For example, you can record yourself singing, playing guitar, or even beatboxing and use the Convert commands to generate MIDI that you can use as a starting point for new music.</p><p>For the most accurate results, we recommend the following:</p><ul><li>Use music that has clear attacks. Notes that fade in or “swell” may not be detected by the conversion process.</li><li>Work with recordings of isolated instruments. The Convert Drums command, for example, works best with unaccompanied drum breaks; if other instruments are present, their notes will be detected as well.</li><li>Use uncompressed, high-quality audio files such as .wav or .aiff. Lossy data formats such as mp3 may result in unpredictable conversions, unless the recordings are at high bitrates.</li></ul><p>Live uses the transient markers (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#transients-and-pseudo-warp-markers">‘Transients and Pseudo Warp Markers’</a>) in the original audio clip to determine the divisions between notes in the converted MIDI clip. This means that you can “tune” the results of the conversion by adding, moving, or deleting transient markers in the audio clip before running any of the Convert commands.</p><p>Although each of the commands has been designed for a particular type of musical material, you can sometimes get very interesting results by applying the “wrong” command. For example, Convert Harmony will usually create chords. So running it on a monophonic clip (like a vocal recording) will often generate notes that weren’t present in the original audio. This can be a great way to spark your creativity.</p></section></section></div>

You can also save and hot-swap grooves via the buttons next to the Groove’s name.</p><p>The Groove Pool’s controls work as follows:</p><ul><li><em>Base</em> — The Base chooser determines the timing resolution against which the notes in the groove will be measured. A 1/4 Base, for example, means that the positions of the notes in the groove file are compared to the nearest quarter note, and all notes in any clips that are assigned to that groove will be moved proportionally towards the positions of the groove notes. At a base of 1/8th, the groove’s notes are measured from their nearest eighth note. Notes in the groove that fall exactly on the grid aren’t moved at all, so the corresponding notes in your clips will also not be moved.</li><li><em>Quantize</em> — adjusts the amount of “straight“ quantization that is applied before the groove is applied. At 100%, the notes in your clips will be snapped to the nearest note values, as selected in the Base chooser. At 0%, the notes in clips will not be moved from their original positions before the groove is applied.</li><li><em>Timing</em> — adjusts how much the groove pattern will affect any clips which are using it.</li><li><em>Random</em> — adjusts how much random timing fluctuation will be applied to clips using the selected groove. At low levels, this can be useful for adding subtle “humanization“ to highly quantized, electronic loops. Note that Random applies differing randomization to every voice in your clip, so notes that originally occurred together will now be randomly offset both from the grid and from each other.</li><li><em>Velocity</em> — adjusts how much the velocity of the notes in clips will be affected by the velocity information stored in the groove file. Note that this slider goes from -100 to +100. At negative values, the effect of the groove’s velocity will be reversed; loud notes will play quietly and vice versa.</li><li><em>Global Amount</em> — this parameter scales the overall intensity of Timing, Random and Velocity for all of the available groove files. At 100%, the parameters will be applied at their assigned values. Note that the Amount slider goes up to 130%, which allows for even more exaggerated groove effects. If grooves are applied to clips in your Set, the Global Amount slider will also appear in Live’s Control Bar.</li></ul><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/GrooveAmountInTransport.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Global Groove Amount Slider in the Control Bar</figcaption></figure></section><section id="committing-grooves" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="13.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">13.1.2</span> Committing Grooves</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CommitGroove.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Commit Groove Button.</figcaption></figure><p>Pressing the Commit button above the Clip Groove chooser “writes“ your groove parameters to the clip.

To edit the contents of groove files directly, drag and drop them from the browser or Groove Pool into a MIDI track. This will create a new MIDI clip, which you can then edit, as you would with any other MIDI clip. You can then convert the edited clip back into a groove, via the process below.</p><section id="extracting-grooves" data-number="1.2.1"><h3 data-number="13.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">13.2.1</span> Extracting Grooves</h3><p>The timing and volume information from any audio or MIDI clip can be extracted to create a new groove.

For example, playing hi-hats in time but placing snare hits slightly behind the beat is a good way of creating a laid-back feel. But because groove files apply to an entire clip at once, this kind of subtlety can be difficult to achieve with a single clip. Provided your clip uses a Drum or Instrument Rack, one solution can be to extract the chain (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/instrument-drum-and-effect-racks/#extracting-chains">‘Extracting Chains’</a>) containing the voice that you want to independently groove. In this example, we’d extract the snare chain, creating a new clip and track that contained only the snare notes. Then we could apply a different groove to this new clip.</p></section><section id="non-destructive-quantization" data-number="1.3.2"><h3 data-number="13.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">13.3.2</span> Non-Destructive Quantization</h3><p>Grooves can be used to apply real-time, non-destructive quantization to clips. To do this, simply set the groove’s Timing, Random and Velocity amounts to 0% and adjust its Quantize and Base parameters to taste. With only Quantize applied, the actual content of the groove is ignored, so this technique works the same regardless of which Groove file you use.</p></section><section id="creating-texture-with-randomization" data-number="1.3.3"><h3 data-number="13.3.3"><span class="header-section-number">13.3.3</span> Creating Texture With Randomization</h3><p>You can use a groove’s Random parameter to create realistic doublings. This can be particularly useful when creating string textures from single voices. To do this, first duplicate the track containing the clip that you want to “thicken.“ Then apply a groove to one of the clips and turn up its Random parameter. When you play the two clips together, each note will be slightly (and randomly) out of sync with its counterpart on the other track.</p></section></section></section></div>

The Follow Action Time control, which is available for both clips and scenes, defines when the Follow Action takes place in bars-beats-sixteenths from the point in the clip or scene where play starts. The default for this setting is one bar. In the Sample/MIDI Notes Editor, a marker visualizes the Follow Action Time of a clip, and dragging this marker adjusts the clip’s Follow Action Time.</li></ol><p>There are ten Follow Actions available:</p><p><span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/NoActionFollowActionIcon.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=152"></span> means that no Follow Action will occur.

Music is repetition and change. Music based on loops or short melodic fragments has a tendency to sound static. Follow Actions allow you to create structures that will repeat but can also be surprising. Remember that you can always record (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/recording-new-clips/#recording-new-clips">‘Recording New Clips’</a>) the results of your experiments, so this can provide a good source for new material.</p><p>In the following sections we will look at some practical examples and ideas for Follow Actions.</p><section id="looping-parts-of-a-clip" data-number="1.7.1"><h3 data-number="15.7.1"><span class="header-section-number">15.7.1</span> Looping Parts of a Clip</h3><p>Let’s say that you want to play a longer clip, but then you want only the last eight bars to loop. You can set this up using Follow Actions:</p><ol type="1"><li>Drag the clip into the Arrangement View and make sure that the Clip View’s Loop switch is not activated. Use the Edit menu’s Split command (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/arrangement-view/#splitting-clips">‘Splitting Clips’</a>) to split the clip between the non-looping and looping parts.</li><li>Click and drag the resulting two clips into the Session View by letting the mouse cursor hover over the Session View selector. Drop the two clips into a track. They now form a Follow Action group.</li></ol><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/FollowActionsWithLoops.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Creating a Group With the Two Clips.</figcaption></figure><ol type="1"><li>Set up Follow Actions for the first clip. You will want to make Follow Action Time equal to the clip’s length. Set the Follow Action A chooser to “Next“, with a Chance setting of 100%, and set Follow Action B to “No Action“. Now this clip is set up to advance to the looping clip after it plays.</li><li>Activate the Loop switch for the second clip.</li></ol><p>The first clip will now proceed to the second after it has played in its entirety; the second clip will simply play in a loop until it is stopped.</p></section><section id="creating-cycles" data-number="1.7.2"><h3 data-number="15.7.2"><span class="header-section-number">15.7.2</span> Creating Cycles</h3><p>One of the most obvious possibilities that Follow Actions open up is using a group of samples to form a musical cycle. If we organize several clips or scenes as a group and use the “Next“ Follow Action with each clip or scene, they will play one after the other ad infinitum, or until we tell them to stop.</p><p>Cycles can be peppered with occasional rearrangements through the addition of other Follow Actions, such as “Any,“ with smaller relative Chance settings.</p><p>You can also set up Follow Actions so that all selected clips play in a loop, by choosing the Create Follow Action Chain command from a clip’s context menu. Note that the clip selection does not have to be contiguous.</p></section><section id="temporarily-looping-clips" data-number="1.7.3"><h3 data-number="15.7.3"><span class="header-section-number">15.7.3</span> Temporarily Looping Clips</h3><p>There are some interesting applications of Follow Actions when it comes to creating temporary musical loops.</p><p>Imagine a group consisting of one single clip. Follow Action A is set to “Play Again,“ with a Chance of 80%. Follow Action B is set to “No Action,“ with a Chance of 20%. The clip uses a long sample, and Follow Time is set to one bar. Clicking on the clip will play the first bar, after which it will be very likely that it will play the first bar again. However, after a few repetitions, it will eventually come to Action B — “No Action“ — and continue playing the rest of the sample.</p><p>Or, a clip can be played from its start to a specific point, when its Follow Action tells it to “Next.“ The same file can be used in the next clip in the group, but this one can be set to loop. This second clip can have any manner of Follow Action settings, so that it might then play forever, for a specified time or until random chance leads to the next clip in the group.</p></section><section id="adding-variations-in-sync" data-number="1.7.4"><h3 data-number="15.7.4"><span class="header-section-number">15.7.4</span> Adding Variations in Sync</h3><p>Paired with clip envelopes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-envelopes/#clip-envelopes">‘Clip Envelopes’</a>) and warping (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#time-warping-samples">‘Time-Warping Samples’</a>), Follow Actions can be used to create all sorts of interesting variations within a group of similar clips. You could, for example, use Follow Actions to randomly trigger clips with different MIDI controller clip envelopes, so that fine variations in pitch bend or modulation of an instrument or synth could occur as the clips in a group interacted. Audio clips could morph between different effect or clip transposition settings.</p><p>Using Follow Actions and Legato Mode together provides a powerful way of gradually changing a melody or beat. Imagine that you have several identical clips of a melody that form a group, and they are set up to play in Legato Mode. Whenever their Follow Actions tell them to move on to another clip in the group, the melody will not change, as Legato Mode will sync the new play position with the old one in beat-time. The settings and clip envelopes of each clip (or even the actual notes contained in a MIDI clip) can then be slowly adjusted, so that the melody goes through a gradual metamorphosis.</p></section><section id="mixing-up-melodies-and-beats" data-number="1.7.5"><h3 data-number="15.7.5"><span class="header-section-number">15.7.5</span> Mixing up Melodies and Beats</h3><p>You can let Follow Actions perform unpredictable remixes and solos for you. Copy a clip containing a beat or melody so that there are several instances of it. Alternatively, you can use several different beats or melodies that you want to mix together. The start and end (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-view/#clip-gain-and-pitch">‘Clip Gain and Pitch’</a>) for each clip can be set differently, as can clip envelopes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-envelopes/#clip-envelopes">‘Clip Envelopes’</a>) and other clip settings. As long as Follow Action Time in each clip is equal to the length of the clip that you want to play, you can set up two Follow Actions with different Chance values in each clip, launch a clip, and surprise yourself.</p></section><section id="creating-nonrepetitive-structures" data-number="1.7.6"><h3 data-number="15.7.6"><span class="header-section-number">15.7.6</span> Creating Nonrepetitive Structures</h3><p>Follow Actions are great when it comes to sound installations, as they allow you to create structures that play for weeks or months and never exactly repeat. You can set the Follow Action Time controls in a series of clips to odd intervals, and the clips will interact with each other so that they never quite play in the same order or musical position. Remember that each clip can have two different Follow Actions with corresponding Chance settings… have fun!</p></section></section></section></div>

Most routing happens in the mixer’s <em>track In/Out section</em>, which offers, for every track, choosers to select a signal source and destination. The mixer’s In/Out section is Live’s “patchbay.“</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SessionMixerInOutSectionAndSectionSelector.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Mixer’s In/Out Section.</figcaption></figure><p>You can show or hide the I/O section of the mixer in either Session or Arrangement View using the In/Out entry in the mixer’s view control menu at the bottom right corner of Live’s window, or via the View menu’s In/Out option in the Mixer Controls submenu, or using the shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>I</kbd> (Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd><kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>I</kbd> (Mac).</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MixerViewControlOptionsIO.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Mixer View Control’s Options Menu.</figcaption></figure><p>For every track that can play clips, the In/Out section has the same layout:</p><ul><li>The upper chooser pair (“Audio/MIDI From“) selects the track’s input. Audio tracks have an audio input, and MIDI tracks have a MIDI input. Return tracks receive their input from the respective sends (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#return-tracks-and-the-main-track">‘Return Tracks and the Main track’</a>).</li><li>The Monitor radio button selects the monitor mode: the conditions under which the track’s input is heard through the track.</li><li>The lower chooser pair (“Audio/MIDI To“) selects the track’s output. All tracks have audio outputs, except for MIDI tracks without instruments. Remember that instruments convert MIDI to audio (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-concepts/#devices-and-the-mixer">‘Devices and the Mixer’</a>).</li></ul><p>Within a chooser pair, the upper chooser selects the signal category (“Ext.,“ for instance, for external connections via an audio or MIDI interface), and is called the Input/Output Type chooser. If this signal type offers sub-selections or channels, they are available from the lower chooser, or the Input/Output Channel chooser. In our “Ext.“ example, these would be the individual audio/MIDI inputs and outputs.</p><section id="monitoring" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="16.1"><span class="header-section-number">16.1</span> Monitoring</h2><p>“Monitoring,“ in the context of Live, means passing a track’s input signal on to the track’s output. Suppose you have set up an audio track to receive its input signal from a guitar. Monitoring then means that the signal from your live guitar playing actually reaches the track’s output, via the track’s device chain. If the track’s output is set to “Main,“ you can hear the guitar signal, processed by whatever effects are used (and delayed by whatever latency the audio hardware interface incurs), over your speakers.</p><p>The In/Out section offers, for every audio track and MIDI track, a <em>Monitor</em> radio button with the following three options:</p><ul><li><p>The default <em>Auto</em>-monitoring setting does the right thing for most straightforward recording applications: Monitoring is on when the track is armed (record-enabled) (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/recording-new-clips/#recording-new-clips">‘Recording New Clips’</a>), but monitoring is inhibited as long as the track is playing clips.</p></li><li><p>To permanently monitor the track’s input, regardless of whether the track is armed or clips are playing, choose <em>In</em>. This setting effectively turns the track into what is called an “Aux“ on some systems: the track is not used for recording but for bringing in a signal from elsewhere. With this setting, output from the clips is suppressed. An “In“ monitoring setting can be easily recognized even when the In/Out section is hidden by the blue color of the track’s Activator switch.</p></li><li><p>Monitoring can be turned off altogether by choosing the <em>Off</em> option. This is useful when recording acoustic instruments which are monitored “through the air,“ when using an external mixing console for monitoring or when using an audio hardware interface with a “direct monitoring“ option that bypasses the computer so as to avoid latency. Generally, it is preferable to work with an audio interface that allows for negligible latencies (a few milliseconds). If you are recording into Live with monitoring set to “Off,“ you may want to make the Audio Preferences’ Overall Latency adjustment, which is described in the built-in program tutorial on setting up the Audio Preferences.</p></li></ul><p>When monitoring is set to “In” or “Auto,” the “Keep Monitoring Latency in Recorded Audio” option will be enabled by default. This adjusts the timing of the recording to match what is heard through Live’s monitoring. Generally speaking it is recommended to leave this option enabled when recording software instruments or effects, and to switch it off when recording acoustic instruments or relying on external monitoring. You can right-click on the “In” or “Auto” monitor buttons to manually switch “Keep Monitoring Latency in Record Audio” on or off.</p><p>If multiple tracks are selected, pressing one of the Monitor buttons applies this selection to all of the selected tracks.</p><p>The Monitor buttons can also be restored to their default state. When the In/Out section is expanded, you can press the Delete key to reset the Monitor buttons to the default (“Off” for audio tracks and “Auto” for MIDI tracks), or you can select the Edit menu option “Return to Default.”</p></section><section id="external-audio-inout" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="16.2"><span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> External Audio In/Out</h2><p>An audio interface’s inputs are selected by choosing “Ext. In“ from the Input Type chooser of an audio track. The Input Channel chooser then offers the individual input channels. Entries in this chooser each have meters next to their names to help you identify signal presence and overload (when the meter flashes red). Setting up the audio interface’s outputs works the same way via the output chooser pair. If multiple tracks are selected, any changes you make to these choosers will be applied to all selected tracks.</p><p>The list of available inputs and outputs depends on the Audio Preferences, which can be reached via the Input and Output Channel choosers’ “Configure…“ option. Note that the Audio Preferences also provide access to the Channel Configuration dialogs, which determine which inputs and outputs are used, and whether they are available to Live as mono or stereo pairs. Essentially, the Channel Configuration dialog tells Live what it needs to know about how the computer is connected to the other audio components in your studio.</p><p>You can rename any input and output channels that appear in the Channel Configuration dialogs. If changed, the new name(s) will be displayed in the corresponding Input / Output Channel chooser drop-down. You can rename channels more quickly by using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move between them. Note that changed names are always associated with their respective audio device.</p><section id="monostereo-conversions" data-number="1.2.1"><h3 data-number="16.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">16.2.1</span> Mono/Stereo Conversions</h3><p>When a mono signal is chosen as an audio track’s input, the track will record mono samples; otherwise it will record stereo samples. Signals in the track’s device chain are always stereo, even when the track’s input is mono or when the track plays mono samples.</p><p>Mono is turned into stereo simply by using the identical signal for left and right channels. When a track is routed into a mono output, the left and right signals are added together and attenuated by 6 dB to avoid clipping.</p></section></section><section id="external-midi-inout" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="16.3"><span class="header-section-number">16.3</span> External MIDI In/Out</h2><p>MIDI from the outside world is routed into Live just like audio. From the Input Type chooser of a MIDI track, you can either select a specific MIDI input port or “All Ins,“ which is the merged input of all external MIDI ports. The Input Channel chooser offers the individual input channels of the selected MIDI port and the merged signal of all channels, “All Channels.“ As is the case with audio inputs, the Input Channel chooser also has meters next to every entry to represent activity on the respective input channel. If multiple MIDI tracks are selected, any changes you make to these choosers will be applied to all selected tracks.</p><section id="midi-port-inputs-and-outputs" data-number="1.3.1"><h3 data-number="16.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">16.3.1</span> MIDI Port Inputs and Outputs</h3><p>You can configure which MIDI ports are made available to Live using the <em>Inputs</em> and <em>Outputs</em> options in the MIDI section of the Link, Tempo &amp; MIDI Preferences.

Resampling can be a fun and useful tool, as it lets you create samples from what is currently happening in a Live Set that can then be immediately integrated. It can be used to record tracks that include processor-intensive devices, so as to delete the devices, or for quickly previewing before rendering to disk (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#exporting-audio-and-video">‘Exporting Audio and Video’</a>).</p><p>The “Resampling“ option in any audio track’s Input Type chooser will route the Main output to that track. You can then decide on what exactly you will be resampling and mute, solo or otherwise adjust the tracks that are feeding the Main output. You will probably want to use the Main Volume meter to make sure that your level is as high as possible without clipping (indicated by red in the meter). Then you can arm the track and record into any of its empty clip slots (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/recording-new-clips/#recording-into-session-slots">‘Recording Into Session Slots’</a>). Note that the recording track’s own output will be suppressed while resampling is taking place, and will not be included in the recording.</p><p>Samples created by resampling will be stored in with the current Set’s Project folder (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#live-projects">‘Live Projects’</a>), under Samples/Recorded. Until the Set is saved, they remain at the location specified by the Temporary Folder (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/recording-new-clips/#where-are-the-recorded-samples">‘Where are the Recorded Samples?’</a>).</p></section><section id="internal-routings" data-number="1.5"><h2 data-number="16.5"><span class="header-section-number">16.5</span> Internal Routings</h2><p>Live’s mixer and external routing devices allow for inter-track routings. These routings, albeit potentially confusing, enable many valuable creative and technical options. Via the mixer, inter-track routing can work two ways:</p><ol type="1"><li>Track A is set up to send its output signal to Track B. This is possible because every track that can receive an output signal of the appropriate type from Track A shows up in its Output Type chooser.</li><li>Track B is set up to receive its input signal from Track A. This works because every track that delivers a signal of the appropriate type appears in Track B’s Input Type chooser.</li></ol><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TwoWaysToRouteTrackAIntoTrackB.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Two Ways to Route Track A into Track B.</figcaption></figure><p>Both approaches result in Track A’s output being fed into Track B. Approach 1 leaves Track B’s in/out settings alone, and we can, at any time, add more tracks that feed their output into Track B. This is the method of choice for “many-to-one“ routings such as submixes or several MIDI tracks playing the same instrument. In this scenario, soloing Track B will still allow you to hear the output of the tracks that are feeding it. Also, you can still solo Track A and hear its output signal. In this case, all other tracks are muted, including those that might also feed into Track B. Technically, what you hear is the output of Track B, with everything except Track A’s signal removed.</p><p>Approach 2, on the other hand, leaves Track A unaffected except for Track B tapping its output. We can easily add more tracks like Track B that all tap Track A’s output. Instrument layering is a good example of such a “one-to-many“ routing setup.</p><section id="internal-routing-points" data-number="1.5.1"><h3 data-number="16.5.1"><span class="header-section-number">16.5.1</span> Internal Routing Points</h3><p>Signals travel from Live’s tracks into their respective device chains and then into the track mixer, where they might become panned or have their levels altered by the tracks’ faders.</p><p>Whenever a track’s Audio From input chooser is set to another track (as described in the previous section’s Approach 2), the signal received can be tapped from one of three different points chosen from the Input Channel chooser: <em>Pre FX, Post FX</em> or <em>Post Mixer</em>.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TrackRoutingTapPoints.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tap Points for Track Routing.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Pre FX</em> taps the signal that is coming directly from a track, before it has been passed on to the track’s device chains (FX) or mixer.

It is certainly powerful to have a separate effects chain per track for applying different effects to different takes — after the fact. You might, however, want to run the guitar signal through effects (a noise gate or an amp model, for instance) <em>before</em> the recording stage, and record the post-effects signal.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/PostFxRecordingRoutingExample.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>An Example Setup for Post-Effects Recording.</figcaption></figure><p>This is easily accomplished by devoting a special audio track for processing and monitoring the incoming guitar signal. We call this track “Guitar“ and drag the desired effects into its device chain. We do not record directly into the Guitar track; instead we create a couple more tracks to use for recording. Those tracks are all set up to receive their input Post FX from the Guitar track. Note that we could also tap the Guitar track Post Mixer if we wished to record any level or panning from it.</p><p>As for monitoring, we set the Guitar track’s Monitor radio button to In, because we always want to listen to our guitar through this track, no matter what else is going on in Live.

A single MIDI note can prompt, for example, Native Instruments’ <em>Absynth</em> to produce something that sounds more like a piece of music than a single tone. This output lends itself more to representation as an audio waveform than a single note in a MIDI clip, particularly when comparing the editing options.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RecordingAbsynthAsAudioRoutingExample.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Recording the Output of a Complex Instrument in Audio Tracks.</figcaption></figure><p>A setup similar to the one described above (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#post-effects-recording">‘Post-Effects Recording’</a>) accomplishes the task.

In the mix, we can easily change the volumes of the individual drums, but adjusting the volume of the entire drum kit against the rest of the music is less convenient. Therefore, we add a new audio track to submix the drums. The individual drum tracks are all set to output to the submix track, which outputs to the Main track. The submix track gives us a handy volume control for the entire drum kit.</p><p>Alternatively, you could combine the separate drum tracks into a Group Track (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#group-tracks">‘Group Tracks’</a>) for even more flexibility.

We have already recorded MIDI clips into this track when we realize that we would like to add an independent, parallel take for the same instrument. So we add another MIDI track. We could now drag another Simpler into the new track, but we would really like to reuse the Simpler from the pad track, so that changing the pad’s sound affects the notes from both tracks.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SeveralMidiTracksPlayingSameInstrumentRoutingExample.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Feeding an Additional MIDI Track Into an Existing MIDI Track to Reuse its Instrument.</figcaption></figure><p>This is accomplished by setting the new MIDI track’s Output Type chooser to the pad track. Note that the Output Channel chooser now offers a selection of destinations: We can either feed the new track’s output into the input of the pad track, or we can directly address the Simpler. The “Track In“ option in the Output Channel represents the pad track’s input signal (the signal to be recorded), which is not what we want. We instead select “Warm Bubbly Pad“ to send the new track’s MIDI directly to the Simpler, bypassing the recording and monitoring stage. With this setup, we can choose to record new takes on either track and they will all play the same pad sound.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SeveralMidiTracksPlayingSameInstrumentRoutingExample2.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Instrument Has Been Isolated in a Dedicated Track.</figcaption></figure><p>We might be bothered by the fact that muting the pad track (by turning off its Activator switch) also mutes the other MIDI track. To be precise, the other track keeps playing, but its MIDI is played by an instrument that is out of the mix. This can be easily remedied by cutting the clips from the pad track and pasting them into a third track that can be independently muted (and that can hold its own MIDI effects). The original pad track now acts as a mere instrument container. As we are not recording new clips into this track, we can set its Input Type chooser to “No Input,“ which makes its Arm button disappear and helps to avoid confusion when the mixer’s In/Out section is hidden.</p></section><section id="tapping-individual-outs-from-an-instrument" data-number="1.5.2.5"><h4 data-number="16.5.2.5"><span class="header-section-number">16.5.2.5</span> Tapping Individual Outs From an Instrument</h4><p>Some software instruments, like Live’s Impulse percussion sampler, offer multiple audio outputs for the signals they produce. By default, Impulse mixes the output of its eight sample slots internally and delivers the mix at the instrument’s audio out. Any audio effects following Impulse in the same track process the composite signal. Sometimes it is desirable to take an individual drum sound out of the mix for individual effects processing and mixing. This is possible because Impulse offers its sample slots as audio sources to other tracks.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ImpulseIndividualOutRoutingExample.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Using Impulse’s Individual Outs to Separately Process Sample Slots.</figcaption></figure><p>We simply create an audio track and select from its Input Type chooser the track with the Impulse. The Input Channel chooser now offers, in addition to Pre FX, Post FX and Post Mixer, Impulse’s eight individual outputs, labeled according to the sample used in each slot. Notice that routing an individual output from Impulse into another track automatically takes this signal out of Impulse’s own internal mix. This convenience is not standard behavior of most plug-in instruments, however. Soloing a track that taps one of Impulse’s sample slots will still allow you to hear the output of that slot.</p></section><section id="using-multi-timbral-plug-in-instruments" data-number="1.5.2.6"><h4 data-number="16.5.2.6"><span class="header-section-number">16.5.2.6</span> Using Multi-Timbral Plug-In Instruments</h4><p>Many plug-in instruments support multi-timbral operation. A multi-timbral instrument is like several instruments in one, with each component “part“ (or whatever term the manufacturer uses) receiving MIDI on a separate MIDI channel. Usually, the multi-timbral instrument offers individual outputs so that the parts can be separately routed into the mixer. Or, the instrument might offer a submixer of its own.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MultiTimbralInstrumentRoutingExample.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tracks Feeding MIDI to and Tapping Audio From the Parts of a Multi-Timbral Instrument.</figcaption></figure><p>Sending MIDI from the mixer to a multi-timbral instrument is a variation of a case described above (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#several-midi-tracks-playing-the-same-instrument">‘Several MIDI Tracks Playing the Same Instrument’</a>). One MIDI track hosts the multi-timbral instrument, and additional MIDI tracks are used to feed its individual parts. Each additional MIDI track has its Output Type chooser pointed to the track that contains the instrument, and its Output Channel chooser referencing the target MIDI channel. Additional audio tracks can then be used to tap the instrument’s individual outputs, as described earlier (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#tapping-individual-outs-from-an-instrument">‘Tapping Individual Outs From an Instrument’</a>).</p><p>It is also possible to use the External Instrument device to route MIDI to (and audio from) the secondary outputs on multi-timbral plug-ins.

You could also put the entire system of External Instrument devices into a single track, by placing each one in a Rack’s device chain.</p><p>Note that the main outputs of the multi-timbral instrument will still output to the track that contains the instrument — only auxiliary outputs are available to the External Instrument device.</p></section><section id="feeding-sidechain-inputs" data-number="1.5.2.7"><h4 data-number="16.5.2.7"><span class="header-section-number">16.5.2.7</span> Feeding Sidechain Inputs</h4><p>Some effects have so-called “sidechain inputs.“ A vocoder, for instance, imposes spectral characteristics taken from one signal (say, spoken word) onto another signal, for instance a string pad. The vocoder is inserted as an audio effect into the string track. It has a sidechain input for the speech signal, which has to be delivered from another track. So, we create an additional audio track named “Speech“ and set its Output Type chooser to the “Strings“ track. From the Output Channel chooser, we select the vocoder’s sidechain input.</p><p>Some vocoder plug-ins include a built-in synthesizer to generate the “carrier“ signal. In this case, the only difference from the above procedure is that the vocoder instrument is dragged into a MIDI track. Feeding the sidechain audio input works as described above.</p><p>A number of Ableton’s built-in devices have their own sidechain controls with integrated routing choosers that match those found in tracks. Thus when using these devices, it is not necessary to follow the above procedure — you can simply select the sidechain source from within the device itself.</p></section><section id="layering-instruments" data-number="1.5.2.8"><h4 data-number="16.5.2.8"><span class="header-section-number">16.5.2.8</span> Layering Instruments</h4><p>Suppose that we have a MIDI track containing an instrument playing a string sound, which we would like to augment by adding a brass sound playing the same notes.

You can also enter your own info text (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/first-steps/#using-the-info-view">‘Using the Info View’</a>) for a track via the Edit Info Text command in the Edit menu or in the tracks’ <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu.</p><p>You can drag tracks by their title bars to rearrange them, or click and drag on their edges to change their width (in the Session View) or height (in the Arrangement View).</p><p>Multiple adjacent or nonadjacent tracks can be selected at once by <kbd>Shift</kbd>-clicking or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-clicking, respectively. If you drag a selection of nonadjacent tracks, they will be collapsed together when dropped. To move nonadjacent tracks without collapsing, use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + arrow keys instead of the mouse.</p><p>When multiple tracks are selected, adjusting one of their mixer controls will adjust the same control for the other tracks. If the tracks in the multi-selection have differing values for any particular knob or slider parameter (volume, for example), this difference will be maintained as you adjust the parameter.</p><p>If you drag a track’s title bar to a folder in the Places section of the browser it will be saved as a new Set. If a track contains audio clips, Live will manage the copying of the referenced samples into this new location based on the selection in the Collect Files on Export chooser (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#collect-files-on-export">‘Collect Files on Export’</a>). You can then type in a name for the newly created Set or confirm the one suggested by Live with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p><p>Tracks are deleted using the Edit menu’s Delete command.</p></section><section id="group-tracks" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="17.3"><span class="header-section-number">17.3</span> Group Tracks</h2><p>You can combine any number of individual audio or MIDI tracks into a special kind of summing container called a Group Track. To create a Group Track, select the tracks to include and execute the Edit menu’s Group Tracks command. You also use this command to nest an existing Group Track(s) within a new Group Track.</p><p>Group Tracks themselves cannot contain clips, but they are similar to audio tracks in that they have mixer controls and can host audio effects.</p><p>Group Tracks also provide a quick way to create submixes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#creating-submixes">‘Creating Submixes’</a>). When tracks are placed into a group, their Audio To routing choosers (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#internal-routings">‘Internal Routings’</a>) are automatically assigned to their Group Track unless they already had a custom routing, i.e. to a destination other than “Main.“ You can also use a Group Track purely as a “folder“ track by rerouting the outputs of the contained tracks to some other destination.</p><p>The tracks in a group can be shown or hidden via the Unfold Group button in the title bar. This can help you to organize large Sets by hiding away tracks that you don’t need to see.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/GroupTrackSession.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>An Unfolded Group Track in Session View.</figcaption></figure><p>Once a Group Track has been created, tracks can be dragged into or out of the group.

However, whereas a clip track’s effect processes only the audio within that track, return tracks can process audio sent to them from numerous tracks.</p><p>For example, suppose you want to create rhythmic echoes with a delay effect. If you drag the effect into a clip track, only clips playing in this track will be echoed. Placing this effect in a return track lets it receive audio from any number of tracks and add echoes to them.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SessionAndArrangerSends.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Send Controls and Pre/Post Toggles.</figcaption></figure><p>A clip or group track’s Send control determines how much of the track’s output feeds the associated return track’s input. What’s more, even the return track’s own output can be routed to its input, allowing you to create feedback. Because runaway feedback can boost the level dramatically and unexpectedly, the Send controls in Return tracks are disabled by default. To enable them, <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) on a Return track’s Send knob and select Enable Send or Enable All Sends.</p><p>Every return track has a Pre/Post toggle that determines if the signal a clip track sends to it is tapped before or after the mixer stage (i.e., the pan, volume and track-active controls). The “Pre“ setting allows you to create an auxiliary mix that is processed in the return track, independently of the main mix. As the return track can be routed to a separate output, this can be used to set up a separate monitor mix for an individual musician in a band.</p><p>The Main track is the default destination for the signals from all other tracks. Drag effects here to process the mixed signal before it goes to the Main output. Effects in the Main track usually provide <em>mastering</em>-related functions, such as compression and/or EQ.</p><p>You can create multiple return tracks using the Create menu’s Insert Return Track command, but by definition, there is only one Main track.</p></section><section id="using-lives-crossfader" data-number="1.5"><h2 data-number="17.5"><span class="header-section-number">17.5</span> Using Live’s Crossfader</h2><p>Live includes a crossfader that can create smooth transitions between clips playing on different tracks.

Seven different crossfade curves are available so that you can choose the one that fits your style the best. To change the curve, <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) on the crossfader, then select an entry from the context menu.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CrossfaderCurvesContextMenu.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Choose from Seven Crossfader Curves.</figcaption></figure><p>The chart below details the power level and response of each crossfader curve.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CrossfaderCurves.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Crossfader Curve Properties.</figcaption></figure><p>The crossfader can be mapped to any continuous MIDI controller (absolute or incremental) (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/midi-and-key-remote-control/#midi-and-key-remote-control">‘MIDI and Key Remote Control’</a>). In addition to the crossfader’s central slider, its absolute left and right positions are separately available for MIDI or keyboard mapping. There are two special scenarios for remote control with respect to the crossfader:</p><ul><li>A key mapped to any one of the three assignable crossfader positions (left, center or right) will toggle the crossfader’s absolute left and right positions.</li><li>Mapping to two of the three fields allows for a “snapping back“ behavior when one of the assigned keys is held down and the other is pressed and released.</li></ul><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TrackCrossFadeAssignSwitches.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Crossfade Assign Buttons.</figcaption></figure><p>Each track has two Crossfade Assign buttons, A and B. The track can have three states with respect to the crossfader:</p><ul><li>If neither Assign button is on, the crossfader does not affect the track at all.</li><li>If A is on, the track will be played unattenuated as long as the crossfader is in the left half of its value range. As the crossfader moves toward the right across the center position, the track fades out. At the crossfader’s rightmost position, the track is muted.</li><li>Likewise, if B is on, the track’s volume will be affected only as the crossfader moves left across its center position.</li></ul><p>It is important to understand that the Crossfade Assign buttons do not affect the signal routing; the crossfader merely influences the signal volume at each track’s gain stage. The track can be routed to an individual output bus regardless of its crossfade assignment. In studio parlance, you can think of the crossfader as an on-the-fly VCA group.</p><p>As with almost everything in Live, your crossfading maneuvers can be recorded into the Arrangement (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/automation-and-editing-envelopes/#automation-and-editing-envelopes">‘Automation and Editing Envelopes’</a>) for later in-depth editing. To edit each track’s crossfade assignment, please choose “Mixer“ from the Envelope Device chooser and “X-Fade Assign“ from the Control chooser. The crossfader’s automation curve is accessible when “Mixer“ is chosen from the Main track’s Device chooser and “Crossfade“ is selected from its Control chooser.</p></section><section id="soloing-and-cueing" data-number="1.6"><h2 data-number="17.6"><span class="header-section-number">17.6</span> Soloing and Cueing</h2><p>By default, soloing a track simply mutes all other tracks (except in some cases where tracks are feeding other tracks (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#internal-routings">‘Internal Routings’</a>)). The signal from the soloed tracks is heard through their respective outputs, with the pan setting of each track preserved. Soloing a clip track leaves any return tracks audible, provided that the Solo in Place option is enabled in the Solo button’s <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu.

This allows choosing clips and adjusting effects without the audience hearing, before bringing tracks into the mix.</p><p>In order to set Live up for cueing, you must be using an audio interface with at least four dedicated outputs (or two dedicated stereo outputs).

On MIDI tracks, this is normally activated automatically when inserting an instrument.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArmButtons.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>MIDI and Audio Track Arm Buttons.</figcaption></figure><p>This is how you would play live instruments through effects on a track, for example, or use a MIDI keyboard’s input to play a track’s instrument. Note that you can easily move from this setup into recording new clips for further use in Live (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/recording-new-clips/#recording-new-clips">‘Recording New Clips’</a>). If you have alternative monitoring preferences, please see the Monitoring section (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#monitoring">‘Monitoring’</a>) to learn how to make these settings.</p><p>To add another device to the track, simply drag it there or double-click its name to append it to the device chain.

The same is true for a MIDI track’s device chain.</p><p>If you drop an <em>instrument</em> into a MIDI track’s device chain, be aware that signals following (to the right of) the instrument are audio signals, available only to audio effects. Signals preceding (to the left of) the instrument are <em>MIDI</em> signals, available only to MIDI effects. This means that it’s possible for a MIDI track’s device chain to hold all three types of devices: first MIDI effects, then an instrument, and finally audio effects.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/DevicesInDeviceView.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A MIDI Track’s Device Chain Can Contain All Three Device Types.</figcaption></figure><p>To remove a device from the chain, click on its title bar and press your computer’s <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> key, or select Delete from the Edit menu.

For more information, please refer to the CPU load section (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/computer-audio-resources-and-strategies/#managing-the-cpu-load">‘Managing the CPU Load’</a>). The Freeze Track command discussed there is especially helpful when working with CPU-intensive devices.</p><p>Devices in Live’s tracks have input and output level meters. These meters are helpful in finding problematic devices in the device chain: Low or absent signals will be revealed by the level meters, and relevant device settings can then be adjusted, or the device can be turned off or removed.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MetersBetweenDevices.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Level Meters Between Devices in a Chain.</figcaption></figure><p>Note that no clipping can occur between devices because there is practically unlimited headroom.

When disabled, all tracks will be in sync, but input-monitored tracks may have higher latency.</p><p>Note that tempo-synced effects and other devices that get timing information from Live’s internal clock may sound out of sync if they are placed in a device chain after devices which cause delay.</p><p>Unusually high individual track delays (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#track-delays">‘Track Delays’</a>) or reported latencies from plug-ins may cause noticeable sluggishness in the software. If you are having latency-related difficulties while recording and playing back instruments, you may want to try turning off device delay compensation, however this is not normally recommended. You may also find that adjusting the individual track delays is useful in these cases, but please note that the Track Delay controls are unavailable when device delay compensation is deactivated.</p><p>Note that device delay compensation can, depending on the number of tracks and devices in use, increase the CPU load.</p></section></section></div>

Racks can be used to build complex signal processors, dynamic performance instruments, stacked synthesizers and more. Yet they also streamline your device chain by bringing together your most essential controls. While Racks excel at handling multiple devices, they can extend the abilities of even a single device by defining new control relationships between its parameters.</p><p>Racks greatly expand upon the concept of device groups introduced in Live 5. The device groups of any Live Sets imported from Live 5 are automatically converted to Racks. <em>Note that these Live Sets, once saved, can no longer be opened in older versions of Live.</em></p><section id="an-overview-of-racks" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="21.1"><span class="header-section-number">21.1</span> An Overview of Racks</h2><section id="signal-flow-and-parallel-device-chains" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="21.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">21.1.1</span> Signal Flow and Parallel Device Chains</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RackExample.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Inside An Audio Effect Rack.</figcaption></figure><p>In any of Live’s tracks, devices are connected serially in a device chain, passing their signals from one device to the next, left to right. By default, the Device View displays only a single chain, but there is actually no limit to the number of chains contained within a track.</p><p>Racks allow (among other things) additional device chains to be added to any track. When a track has multiple chains, they operate in <em>parallel</em>: In Instrument and Effect Racks, each chain receives the same input signal at the same time, but then processes its signal <em>serially</em> through its own devices. The output of each of the parallel chains is mixed together, producing the Rack’s output.</p><p>Drum Racks also allow multiple parallel chains to be used simultaneously, but their chains process input somewhat differently: Rather than receiving the same input signals, each Drum Rack chain receives input from only a single assigned MIDI note.</p><p><em>The entire contents of any Rack can be thought of as a single device</em>. This means that adding a new Rack at any point in a device chain is no different than adding any other device, and Racks can contain any number of other Racks. If more devices are placed after a Rack in a track’s device chain, the Rack’s output is passed on to them, as usual.</p></section><section id="macro-controls" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="21.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">21.1.2</span> Macro Controls</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RackMacros.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Macro Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>One unique property of Racks are their Macro Controls.</p><p>The Macro Controls are a bank of knobs, each capable of addressing any number of parameters from any devices in a Rack.

Just as with track types, each kind of Rack has rules regarding the devices it contains:</p><ul><li><em>MIDI Effect Racks</em> contain only MIDI effects, and can only be placed in MIDI tracks.</li><li><em>Audio Effect Racks</em> contain only audio effects, and can be placed in audio tracks. They can also be placed in MIDI tracks, as long as they are “downstream“ from an instrument.</li><li><em>Instrument Racks</em> contain instruments, but can additionally contain both MIDI and audio effects. In this case, all MIDI effects have to be at the beginning of the Instrument Rack’s device chain, followed by an instrument, and then any audio effects.</li><li><em>Drum Racks</em> (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/instrument-drum-and-effect-racks/#drum-racks">‘Drum Racks’</a>) are similar to Instrument Racks; they can contain instruments as well as MIDI and audio effects and their devices must be ordered according to the same signal flow rules. Drum Racks can also contain up to six return chains of audio effects, with independent send levels for each chain in the main Rack.</li></ul><p>There are different ways to create Racks. A new, empty Rack can be created by dragging a generic Rack preset (“<em>Audio Effect Rack</em>,“ for example) from the browser into a track. Devices can then be dropped directly into the Rack’s Chain List or Devices view, which are introduced in the next section.</p><p>If a track already has one or more devices that you would like to group into a Rack, then simply select the title bars of those devices in the Device View, and <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) on one of the title bars to reveal the <em>Group</em> and <em>Group to Drum Rack</em> commands in the context menu. Note that if you repeat this command again on the same device, you will create a Rack within a Rack. You can also group multiple chains within a Rack using the same procedure. Doing this also creates a Rack within a Rack. In the Device View, the contents of Racks are always contained between end brackets: Just as with punctuation or in mathematics, a Rack within a Rack will have a pair of brackets within a pair of brackets.</p><p>To ungroup devices, dismantling their Racks, select the <em>Rack’s</em> title bar, and then use the Edit menu or the context menu to access the <em>Ungroup</em> command.</p></section><section id="looking-at-racks" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="21.3"><span class="header-section-number">21.3</span> Looking at Racks</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RackExampleMarkup.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Components of an Effect Rack.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/DrumRackExampleMarkup.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Components of a Drum Rack.</figcaption></figure><ol type="1"><li>Racks have distinct views that can be shown or hidden as needed.

The adjacent Hide button whisks them out of sight.</p><p>Note: Audio Effect Racks do not have key or velocity zones, since these two zone types filter MIDI data only. Likewise, Drum Racks have no zones at all; they filter MIDI notes based on choosers in their chain lists.</p><p>Zones contain a lower, main section, used for resizing and moving the zone itself, and a narrow upper section that defines fade ranges.

These Racks have chain select zones, which allow you to filter chains spontaneously via a single parameter. The editor has a scale of 0-127, similar to the Velocity Zone Editor. Above the value scale, however, you will find a draggable indicator known as the Chain selector.</p><p>The chain select zone is a data filter just like the other zones; although all chains in a Rack receive input signals, only those with chain select zones that overlap the current value of the Chain selector can be addressed and thereby produce output.</p><p>By default, the chain select zones of Instrument and MIDI Effect Racks filter only notes, ignoring all other incoming MIDI events (such as MIDI CCs). To filter all MIDI events, enable the Chain Selector Filters MIDI Ctrl option, available in the context menu <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) of a Rack’s Chain Select Ruler.</p><p>In MIDI Effect Racks, fade ranges attenuate the velocities of notes entering a chain. In Instrument Racks and Audio Effect Racks, which both output audio signals, fade ranges attenuate the volume level at each chain’s output. So what happens, then, if the Chain selector is moved outside of the chain select zone where a sound is currently playing? If the zone ends in a fade range, the chain’s output volume is attenuated to zero while the Chain selector is outside of the zone. If the zone had no fade range, the output volume is <em>not</em> attenuated, allowing the chain’s effects (like long reverb tails or delays) to fade out according to their own settings.</p><p>Let’s consider how we can make use of chain select zones in a performance situation:</p><section id="making-preset-banks-using-chain-select" data-number="1.5.4.1"><h4 data-number="21.5.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">21.5.4.1</span> Making Preset Banks Using Chain Select</h4><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RackChainSelectPresets.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Using Chain Select Zones to Create Effects Presets.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the other zone types, the default length of a chain select zone is 1, and the default value is 0.

Each of the four chains contain different effects that we would like to be able to switch between. To make this a “hands-on“ experience, we have MIDI-mapped the Chain selector to an encoder on an external control surface.</p><p>Let’s move the chain select zones of the second and third chains so that each of our zones is occupying its own adjacent value: The first chain’s zone has a value of 0, the second chain’s zone has a value of 1, the third has a value of 2, and the fourth has a value of 3.</p><p>Since each of our chain select zones has a unique value, with no two zones overlapping, we now have a situation where only one chain at a time can ever be equal to the Chain selector value (shown at the top of the editor). Therefore, by moving the Chain selector, we determine which chain can process signals. With our MIDI encoder at hand, we can now flip effortlessly between instrument or effect setups.</p></section><section id="crossfading-preset-banks-using-fade-ranges" data-number="1.5.4.2"><h4 data-number="21.5.4.2"><span class="header-section-number">21.5.4.2</span> Crossfading Preset Banks Using Fade Ranges</h4><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RackChainSelectPresetsCrossfade.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Crossfading Between Effects Presets Using Chain Select Zones.</figcaption></figure><p>Taking the previous example one step further, we can tweak our chain select zones to produce a smooth transition between our “presets.“ To accomplish this, we will make use of our zones’ <em>fade ranges</em>.</p><p>To create some room for fading, let’s extend the length of our zones a bit.

The Receive chooser sets the incoming MIDI note to which the drum chain will respond. The list shows note names, MIDI note numbers and standard GM drum equivalents.

If “All Notes“ is selected in the Receive chooser, the Play and Choke choosers are disabled — in this case, the chain simply passes the note that it receives to its devices.

Each pad represents one of the 128 available MIDI notes. The pad overview to the left shifts the set of visible pads up or down in groups of 16, either by dragging the view selector to a new area or by using your computer keyboard’s up and down arrow keys. Use the <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) modifier to shift the view by single rows instead.</p><p>Almost any object from Live’s browser — samples, effects, instruments and presets — can be dragged onto a pad, mapping automatically to the pad’s note and creating or reconfiguring internal chains and devices as necessary. Dropping a sample onto an empty pad, for example, creates a new chain containing a Simpler, with the dropped sample ready to play from the pad’s note. If you then drag an audio effect to the same pad, it is placed downstream from the Simpler in the same chain. To replace the Simpler, simply drop another sample onto the same pad — any downstream audio effects or upstream MIDI effects will be left intact and only the Simpler and sample will be replaced.</p><p>In addition to dragging objects from the browser, pads can also be filled quickly via Hot-Swap. If you’re in Hot-Swap mode, pressing the <kbd>D</kbd> key will toggle the Hot-Swap target between the Drum Rack itself and the last selected pad.</p><p>If a multi-selection of samples is dropped onto a pad, new Simplers and chains will be mapped upwards chromatically from this pad, replacing any other samples that may have already been assigned to the pads in question (but, as before, leaving any effects devices alone). <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac)-dragging a multi-selection layers all of the samples to a single pad, by creating a nested Instrument Rack.</p><p>Dragging a pad to another pad swaps the note mapping between the pads. This means that any MIDI clips triggering the affected notes will now play the “wrong“ sounds — although this might be exactly what you want. <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac)-dragging one pad to another will layer any chains from both pads in a nested Instrument Rack.</p><p>You can always change your mappings from within the chain list as well, by adjusting the Receive choosers. The Pad View will update automatically to reflect your changes. If you set the same Receive note for multiple chains, that note’s pad will trigger them all.</p><p>If you’re working with lots of nested Racks, the inner structure can quickly become complicated. Pad View can make it much easier to work by letting you focus on only the top level: the notes and sounds. It’s important to remember that a pad represents a note, rather than a chain. More specifically, it represents all chains, no matter how deep in the Rack, that are able to receive that pad’s note. What you can control with each pad is related to how many chains it represents:</p><ul><li>An empty pad shows only the note it will trigger. When you mouse over it, the Status Bar will display this note, as well as the suggested GM instrument.</li><li>A pad that triggers only one chain shows the name of the chain. In this case, the pad serves as a handy front-end for many controls that are normally accessed in the chain list, such as mute, solo, preview and Hot-Swap. You can also rename and delete the chain via the pad.</li><li>A pad that triggers multiple chains shows “Multi“ as its name, and its mute, solo and preview buttons will affect all of its chains. If you mute and solo chains individually within the chain list, the pad’s icons reflect this mixed state. Hot-Swap and renaming are disabled for a Multi pad, but you can delete all of its chains at once.</li></ul><p>Although Pad View is designed for easy editing and sound design, it also excels as a performance interface, particularly when triggered by a hardware control surface with pads. If your pad controller is one of Ableton’s natively supported control surfaces (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/midi-and-key-remote-control/#natively-supported-control-surfaces">‘Natively Supported Control Surfaces’</a>), simply select it as a control surface in the Link/Tempo/MIDI tab of Live’s Preferences. From then on, as long as you have a Drum Rack on a track that’s receiving MIDI, your pad controller will trigger the pads that are visible on your screen. If you scroll the pad overview to show a different set of pads, your controller will update automatically.</p></section></section><section id="using-the-macro-controls" data-number="1.7"><h2 data-number="21.7"><span class="header-section-number">21.7</span> Using the Macro Controls</h2><p>It is possible to use up to 16 Macro Controls in a Rack.

Likewise, many chain operations such as reordering, renaming and regrouping can be performed from either the mixer or the chain list. Clicking in a chain’s mixer title bar shows only that chain’s devices in the Device View.</p><p>As with tracks, when chains are multiselected in the Session View mixer, adjusting a mixer parameter for one of the chains will adjust the same parameter in the other selected chains.

A Drum Rack’s return chains can also be extracted, and will create new return tracks if dragged to the mixer. Drum chains have an additional feature: when dragged from the mixer to a new track, they take their MIDI notes with them. For example, if you are working on a MIDI drum loop within a single track and decide that you would like to move just the snare onto its own track, simply select the snare chain’s title bar in the mixer and drag it to the mixer’s drop area. This creates a new track with the full contents of the snare chain: both its devices and its MIDI data. If you would like to extract only the devices, drag from the chain list instead of from the mixer.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/DrumRackExtract.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Extracting Drum Chains in the Mixer Extracts MIDI Data.</figcaption></figure></section></section></section></div>

In the Arrangement View, you can use the Consolidate command (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/arrangement-view/#consolidating-clips">‘Consolidating Clips’</a>) to create new samples.</p></section><section id="changing-pitch-and-tuning-per-note" data-number="1.2.2"><h3 data-number="23.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">23.2.2</span> Changing Pitch and Tuning per Note</h3><p>Drop a sample loop from the browser into Live, make sure the Warp switch (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#time-warping-samples">‘Time-Warping Samples’</a>) is enabled and play the clip. Select “Clip” in the Device chooser and “Transposition” in the Control chooser. You can now alter the pitch transposition of individual notes in the sample as you listen to it.</p><p>The fast way to do this is by enabling Draw Mode (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/automation-and-editing-envelopes/#drawing-envelopes">‘Drawing Envelopes’</a>) and drawing steps along the grid. Deactivate Draw Mode to edit breakpoints and line segments. This is useful for smoothing the coarse steps by horizontally displacing breakpoints.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TransposeEnvStepsAndBreakpoints.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Transposition Envelope with Steps (Top) and Ramps (Bottom).</figcaption></figure><p>Note that the warp settings determine how accurately Live’s time-warping engine tracks the envelope shape.

Sample offset modulation makes the most sense for rhythmical samples, and is only available for clips that are set up to run in the Beats Warp Mode.</p><p>Try sample offset modulation with a one-bar drum loop: Make sure Beats Mode is chosen; in the Envelopes tab, choose “Clip“ from the Device chooser and “Sample Offset“ from the Control chooser. The Envelope Editor appears with a vertical grid overlay. In envelope Draw Mode, set steps to non-zero values to hear the loop scrambled. What is going on?</p><p>Imagine the audio is read out by a tape head, the position of which is modulated by the envelope. The higher a value the envelope delivers, the farther away the tape head is from its center position. Positive envelope values move the head towards the “future,“ negative values move it towards the “past.“ Fortunately, Live performs the modulation in beats rather than centimeters: A vertical grid line is worth a sixteenth note of offset and the modulation can reach from plus eight sixteenths to minus eight sixteenths.</p><p>Sample offset modulation is the tool of choice for quickly creating interesting variations of beat loops. We discourage using this technique for “analytical“ cut-and-splice tasks; they are much easier to perform using Live’s Arrangement View, and the results can easily be consolidated into new clips.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TypicalOffsetEnvelopeShapes.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Repeating Steps and Slowing Time with the Sample Offset Envelope.</figcaption></figure><p>Some sample offset envelope gestures have a characteristic effect: a downward “escalator“ shape, for instance, effectively repeats the step at the envelope’s beginning. Similarly, a smooth ramp with a downwards slope is slowing time and can create nice slurring effects when the slope is not quite exactly 45 degrees; try this with a 1/32 Granulation Resolution.</p></section><section id="using-clips-as-templates" data-number="1.2.5"><h3 data-number="23.2.5"><span class="header-section-number">23.2.5</span> Using Clips as Templates</h3><p>As you are making creative use of clip envelopes, the clips containing them develop a life of their own, independent of the original sample. You might wonder at a point: What does this clip sound like with a different sample? This is easy to find out by selecting the clip so that it is displayed in the Clip View and dragging the desired sample from the browser, or the Session or Arrangement View, onto the Clip View. All clip settings, including the envelopes, will remain unaltered; only the sample will be replaced.</p></section></section><section id="mixer-and-device-clip-envelopes" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="23.3"><span class="header-section-number">23.3</span> Mixer and Device Clip Envelopes</h2><p>Clip envelopes can be used to <em>automate</em> or <em>modulate</em> mixer and device controls. Since mixer and device controls can potentially be controlled by both types of envelopes at the same time (and also by the Arrangement’s automation envelopes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/automation-and-editing-envelopes/#drawing-and-editing-automation">‘Drawing and Editing Automation’</a>)), this is a potential source of confusion. However, modulation envelopes differ from automation envelopes in one important way: Whereas automation envelopes define the absolute value of a control at any given point in time, modulation envelopes can only influence this defined value. This difference allows the two types of envelopes to work together in harmony when controlling the same parameter. To help you distinguish between these, automation envelopes are colored in red, whereas modulation envelopes are colored in blue. Additionally, in parameters with knob controls, automation moves the absolute position (or the “needle”), whereas modulation is indicated by the blue segment on the ring.</p><p>Imagine that you have recorded volume automation for an audio clip so that it gradually fades out over four bars. What happens to your fade-out when you create a modulation envelope that gradually increases the mixer volume over four bars? At first, your fade-out will become a crescendo, as the modulation envelope gradually increases the volume within the range allowed by the automation envelope. But, once the decreasing automated value meets with the increasing modulation envelope value, the fade-out will begin, as automation forces the absolute control value (and the operable range of the modulation envelope) down.</p><p>Both automation and modulation clip envelopes are available for clips in the Session View. A toggle beneath the envelope choosers allows you to switch between editing automation and modulation clip envelopes for the selected parameter. In the Arrangement, clips only have modulation envelopes, while the automation envelopes reside on the track’s automation lane (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/automation-and-editing-envelopes/#drawing-and-editing-automation">‘Drawing and Editing Automation’</a>).</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ClipAutomationModulationToggle.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Toggle Between Editing Automation and Modulation Envelopes.</figcaption></figure><p>In a clip, parameters that have an automation envelope are indicated by a red LED in the Control chooser.

Now, as you play the clip, you can hear the eight-bar fade-out repeating. You can draw or edit any envelope to superimpose onto the sample loop. This, of course, not only works for volume but for any other control as well; how about a filter sweep every four bars?</p><p>Note that you can create as much time as needed in the Envelope Editor, either by dragging the loop braces beyond the view limit, or by entering values into the numeric region/loop controls.</p><p>You can choose an arbitrary loop length for each envelope, including odd lengths like 3.2.1.

The volume envelope loop now works as a pattern that is repeatedly “punching“ holes into the music so as to, perhaps, remove every third beat.

The Working with Instruments and Effects chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#working-with-instruments-and-effects">‘Working with Instruments and Effects’</a>) explains the basics of using effects in Live.</p><section id="amp" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="25.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.1</span> Amp</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Amp.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Amp Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Amp effect is not available in the Intro, Lite and Standard Editions.)</p><p>Amp is an effect that emulates the sound and character of seven classic guitar amplifiers. Developed in collaboration with Softube, Amp uses physical modelling technology to provide a range of authentic and usable amplifier tones, with a simple and consistent set of controls.</p><p>There are seven amp models to choose from:</p><ul><li><em>Clean</em> is based on the ”Brilliant” channel of a classic amp from the ’60s. This amp was widely used by guitarists of the British Invasion.</li><li><em>Boost</em> is based on the ”Tremolo” channel of the same amp, and is great for edgy rock riffs.</li><li><em>Blues</em> is based on a ’70s-era guitar amp with a bright character. This classic amp is popular with country, rock and blues guitarists.</li><li><em>Rock</em> is modeled after a classic 45 watt amp from the ’60s. This is perhaps the best known rock amp of all time.</li><li><em>Lead</em> is based on the ”Modern” channel of a high-gain amp popular with metal guitarists.</li><li><em>Heavy</em> is based on the ”Vintage” channel of the same amp and is also ideal for metal and grunge sounds.</li><li><em>Bass</em> is modeled after a rare PA from the ’70s which has become popular with bass players due to its strong low end and ”fuzz” at high volumes.</li></ul><p>Although the real-world versions of these amplifiers all have unique parameters, Live’s Amp effect uses the same set of controls for each model. This makes it very easy to quickly change the overall character of your sound without having to make numerous adjustments.</p><p>Gain adjusts the level of input to the preamplifier, while Volume adjusts the output stage of the power amplifier. Although Gain and Volume work together to determine Amp’s overall level, Gain is the primary control for the distortion amount. Higher Gain settings result in a more distorted sound. When using the Blues, Heavy and Bass models, high Volume levels can also add considerable distortion.</p><p>The Bass, Middle and Treble knobs are EQ controls that adjust the timbre of the sound. As on a real-world amplifier, Amp’s EQ parameters interact with each other — and with the rest of Amp’s parameters — in non-linear and sometimes unpredictable ways. For example, increasing EQ levels can, in some cases, also increase the amount of distortion.</p><p>Presence is an additional tone control for mid/high frequencies in the power amp stage. Its influence on the sound varies considerably depending on the amp model used but can add (or subtract) ”edge” or ”crispness.”</p><p>The Output switch toggles between mono and stereo (Dual) processing. Note that in Dual mode, Amp uses twice as much CPU.</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.</p><section id="amp-tips" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="25.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.1.1</span> Amp Tips</h3><p>Because Amp is modeled on real-world analog devices, its behavior can sometimes be difficult to predict. Here are some tips on getting the most out of Amp:</p><section id="amps-and-cabinets" data-number="1.1.1.1"><h4 data-number="25.1.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.1.1.1</span> Amps and Cabinets</h4><p>Guitar amps are designed to be used with accompanying speaker cabinets. For this reason, Amp comes with a companion effect called Cabinet (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#cabinet">‘Cabinet’</a>) which is designed to be used <em>after</em> Amp in a device chain. If you’re looking for authenticity, we recommend this signal flow. But you can also achieve interesting and exotic sounds by using Amp and Cabinet independently.</p></section><section id="electricity" data-number="1.1.1.2"><h4 data-number="25.1.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.1.1.2</span> Electricity</h4><p>The various circuits in guitar amps work with a continuous and fixed amount of electricity. For this reason, turning up a particular parameter may inadvertently decrease the amount of available energy somewhere else in the amp. This is particularly noticeable in the EQ controls. For example, turning up Treble can reduce the level of bass and midrange frequencies. You may find that you need to carefully adjust a number of seemingly unrelated parameters to get the results you want.</p></section><section id="more-than-guitars" data-number="1.1.1.3"><h4 data-number="25.1.1.3"><span class="header-section-number">25.1.1.3</span> More than guitars</h4><p>While Amp and Cabinet sound great with guitars, you can get very interesting results by feeding them with drums, synthesizers or other sound sources. For example, try using Amp with Operator (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#operator">‘Operator’</a>) or Analog (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#analog">‘Analog’</a>) to add analog grit to your digital sounds.</p></section></section></section><section id="auto-filter" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="25.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.2</span> Auto Filter</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AutoFilter.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Auto Filter Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>The Auto Filter effect provides classic analog filter emulation. It can be modulated by an envelope follower and/or an LFO to create moving filter effects. The envelope follower can track either the filtered signal or an external sidechain source.</p><p>Auto Filter offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers.</p><p>The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ Eight (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#eq-eight">‘EQ Eight’</a>). This is available for all of the filter types.</p><p>The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all filter types.</p><p>The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point.</p><p>When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter.</p><p>The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.</p><p>Tip: you can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via dedicated options in the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu of the Morph knob.</p><p>You can adjust Frequency and Resonance by clicking and dragging in the X-Y controller or via the knobs. You can also click on the Freq and Res numeric displays and type in exact values.</p><p>When using the non-Clean circuit types, the Resonance control allows for self-oscillation. At Resonance values above 100%, the filter will continue to ring indefinitely even after the input signal has been stopped. The pitch of the self-oscillation depends on both the Frequency and Resonance values.</p><p>The Envelope section controls how the envelope modulation affects the filter frequency. The Amount control defines the extent to which the envelope affects the filter frequency, while the Attack control sets how the envelope responds to rising input signals. Low Attack values cause a fast response to input levels; high values integrate any changes gradually, creating a looser, slower response. Think of it as adding inertia to the response.</p><p>Lower Release values cause the envelope to respond more quickly to falling input signals. Higher values extend the envelope’s decay.</p><p>Normally, the signal being filtered and the input source that triggers the envelope follower are the same signal. But by using <em>sidechaining</em>, it is possible to filter a signal based on the envelope of another signal. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Auto Filter window by toggling the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_fold1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in its title bar.</p><p>Enabling this section with the Sidechain button allows you to select another track from the choosers below. This causes the selected track’s signal to trigger the filter’s envelope follower, instead of the signal that is actually being filtered.</p><p>The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the envelope follower’s trigger. With Dry/Wet at 100%, the envelope follower tracks the sidechain source exclusively. At 0%, the sidechain is effectively bypassed. Note that increasing the gain does not increase the volume of the source signal in the mix. The sidechain audio is only a trigger for the envelope follower and is never actually heard.</p><p>The Auto Filter also contains a Low Frequency Oscillator to modulate filter frequency in a periodic fashion. The respective Amount control sets how much the LFO affects the filter. This can be used in conjunction with or instead of the envelope follower.</p><p>The Rate control specifies the LFO speed. It can be set in terms of hertz, or synced to the song tempo, allowing for controlled rhythmic filtering.</p><p>Available LFO waveform shapes are sine (creates smooth modulations with rounded peaks and valleys), square, triangle, sawtooth up, sawtooth down, and sample and hold (generates random positive and negative modulation values) in mono and stereo.</p><p>There are two LFOs, one for each stereo channel. The Phase and Offset controls define the relationship between these two LFOs.</p><p>Phase keeps both LFOs at the same frequency, but can set the two LFO waveforms ”out of phase” with each other, creating stereo movement. Set to ”180”, the LFO outputs are 180 degrees apart, so that when one LFO reaches its peak, the other is at its minimum.</p><p>Spin detunes the two LFO speeds relative to each other. Each stereo channel is modulated at a different frequency, as determined by the Spin amount.</p><p>For sample and hold (“S&amp;H”), the Phase and Spin controls are not relevant and do not affect the sound. Instead, the Auto Filter offers two kinds of sample and hold: The upper sample and hold type available in the chooser provides independent random modulation generators for the left and right channels (stereo), while the lower one modulates both channels with the same signal (mono).</p><p>The Quantize Beat control applies quantized modulation to the filter frequency. With Quantize Beat off, frequency modulation follows the control source (the Envelope, LFO, or manually-adjusted cutoff.) Turning this feature on updates the filter modulation rhythmically with ”stepped” changes that track the master tempo. The numbered buttons represent 16th notes, so, for example, selecting ”4” as a beat value produces a modulation change once per beat.</p><section id="legacy-filters" data-number="1.2.0.1"><h4 data-number="25.2.0.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.2.0.1</span> Legacy Filters</h4><p>If you open a Set that was created in a version of Live older than version 9.5, any instance of Auto Filter in the Set will open with legacy filters in place of the filters discussed previously. These consist of 12 dB or 24 dB low-pass, band-pass and high-pass filters, as well as a notch filter, and do not feature a Drive control. Each Auto Filter loaded with the legacy filters shows an Upgrade button in the title bar. Pressing this button will permanently switch the filter selection to the newer models for that instance of Auto Filter. Note that this change may make your Set sound different.</p></section></section><section id="auto-pan" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="25.3"><span class="header-section-number">25.3</span> Auto Pan</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AutoPan.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Auto Pan Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Auto Pan effect is not available in the Lite Edition.)</p><p>Auto Pan offers LFO-driven manipulation of amplitude and panning for creating automatic panning, tremolo and amplitude modulation, and beat-synchronized chopping effects.</p><p>Auto Pan’s LFOs modulate the amplitude of the left and right stereo channels with sine, triangle, sawtooth down or random waveforms.</p><p>The Shape control pushes the waveform to its upper and lower limits, ”hardening” its shape. The waveform can be set to ”Normal” or ”Invert” (use ”Invert” to, for example, create the saw up waveform from the saw down waveform).</p><p>LFO speed is controlled with the Rate control, which can be set in terms of hertz. Rate can also be synced to the song tempo.</p><p>Though both LFOs run at the same frequency, the Phase control lends the sound stereo movement by offsetting their waveforms relative to each other. Set this to ”180”, and the LFOs will be perfectly out of phase (180 degrees apart), so that when one reaches its peak, the other is at its minimum. Phase is particularly effective for creating vibrato effects.</p><p>The Offset control shifts the start point of each LFO along its waveform.</p><p>The device’s influence on incoming signals is set with the Amount control.</p></section><section id="beat-repeat" data-number="1.4"><h2 data-number="25.4"><span class="header-section-number">25.4</span> Beat Repeat</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/BeatRepeat.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Beat Repeat Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>Beat Repeat allows for the creation of controlled or randomized repetitions of an incoming signal.</p><p>The Interval control defines how often Beat Repeat captures new material and begins repeating it. Interval is synced to and set in terms of the song tempo, with values ranging from ”1/32” to ”4 Bars.” The Offset control shifts the point defined by Interval forward in time. If Interval is set to ”1 Bar,” for example, and Offset to ”8/16”, material will be captured for repetition once per bar on the third beat (i.e., halfway, or eight-sixteenths of the way, through the bar).</p><p>You can add randomness to the process using the Chance control, which defines the likelihood of repetitions actually taking place when Interval and Offset ”ask” for them. If Chance is set to 100 percent, repetitions will always take place at the given Interval/Offset time; if set to zero, there will be no repetitions.</p><p>Gate defines the total length of all repetitions in sixteenth notes. If Gate is set to ”4/16”, the repetitions will occur over the period of one beat, starting at the position defined by Interval and Offset.</p><p>Activating the Repeat button bypasses all of the above controls, immediately capturing material and repeating it until deactivated.</p><p>The Grid control defines the grid size — the size of each repeated slice. If set to ”1/16”, a slice the size of one sixteenth note will be captured and repeated for the given Gate length (or until Repeat is deactivated). Large grid values create rhythmic loops, while small values create sonic artifacts. The No Triplets button sets grid division as binary.</p><p>Grid size can be changed randomly using the Variation control. If Variation is set to ”0”, grid size is fixed. But when Variation is set to higher values, the grid fluctuates considerably around the set Grid value. Variation has several different modes, available in the chooser below: Trigger creates variations of the grid when repetitions are triggered; 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16 trigger variations in regular intervals; and Auto forces Beat Repeat to apply a new random variation after each repetition — the most complex form of grid variation in Beat Repeat (especially if triplets are also allowed).</p><p>Beat Repeat’s repetitions can be pitched down for special sonic effects. Pitch is adjusted through resampling in Beat Repeat, lengthening segments to pitch them down without again compressing them to adjust for the length change. This means that the rhythmical structure can become quite ambiguous with higher Pitch values. The Pitch Decay control tapers the pitch curve, making each repeated slice play lower than the previous one. Warning: This is the most obscure parameter of Beat Repeat.</p><p>Beat Repeat includes a combined low-pass and high-pass filter for defining the passed frequency range of the device. You can turn the filter on and off, and set the center frequency and width of the passed frequency band, using the respective controls.</p><p>The original signal (which was received at Beat Repeat’s input) is mixed with Beat Repeat’s repetitions according to one of three mix modes: Mix allows the original signal to pass through the device and have repetitions added to it; Insert mutes the original signal when repetitions are playing but passes it otherwise; and Gate passes only the repetitions, never passing the original signal. Gate mode is especially useful when the effect is housed in a return track.</p><p>You can set the output level of the device using the Volume control, and apply Decay to create gradually fading repetitions.</p></section><section id="cabinet" data-number="1.5"><h2 data-number="25.5"><span class="header-section-number">25.5</span> Cabinet</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Cabinet.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=182"><figcaption>The Cabinet Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Cabinet effect is not available in the Intro, Lite and Standard Editions.)</p><p>Cabinet is an effect that emulates the sound of five classic guitar cabinets.

Chorus is no longer part of the Core Library as of 11.0 but can still be found in the User Library. Live Sets that were made in earlier versions, e.g. 10.1.30,  that contain Chorus will still open with that specific device in 11.0 and later.</p><p>The Chorus effect uses two parallel time-modulated delays to create chorus (thickening) and flanging effects.</p><p>Each delay has its own delay time control, calibrated in milliseconds. Delay 1 has a high-pass filter that can remove low frequencies from the delayed signal. Greater high-pass values let only very high frequencies pass through to Delay 1.</p><p>Delay 2 can switch among three different modes. When off, only Delay 1 is audible. In Fix Mode, only Delay 1’s delay time will be modulated. When Mod is activated, Delay 2 will receive the same modulation as Delay 1.</p><p>To set both delay lines to Delay 1’s delay time, turn on the link button (”=”).

With a wide variety of tools for thickening sounds, creating flanging and vibrato effects, this device also allows you to easily recreate string ensemble chorus sounds.</p><p>Three different modes are provided, which can be chosen in the display: Classic, Ensemble, and Vibrato.</p><p>Classic mode creates a thickened sound by adding two time-modulated delayed signals to the input. Use it for a classic chorus sound, adding light motion to your audio signal.</p><p>Ensemble mode is inspired by a thick three-delay line chorus pedal used in the ‘70s. Ensemble mode is based on and shares controls with Classic mode, but creates richer, smoother, and more intense chorus sound by using three delayed signals with evenly split modulation phase offsets.</p><p>Vibrato mode applies stronger modulation than a chorus to create pitch variation. The shape of the modulation waveform can morph seamlessly from a sine to a triangle, and be used to create well-known “police siren” sounds.</p><p>In addition to the mode selector buttons, the display also provides access to a high-pass filter and the Width parameter. Width is active in Classic and Ensemble modes, but while in Vibrato mode, this parameter is replaced by Offset and Shape controls.</p><p>When enabled, the high-pass filter reduces the chorus effect on signal components below the frequency set by the High-Pass Frequency slider, ranging from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz.</p><p>Width sets the stereo width of the wet signal, which in turn adjusts the chorus level balance between the mid and side channels. At 0% the signal will be mono, at 100% the balance is equal, and at 200% the chorus level is twice as loud in the sides as in the middle. This is used for maintaining the level of the effect across the stereo field, which can be helpful during mixing.</p><p>When using Vibrato mode, Offset adjusts the amount of phase offset between the waveforms for the left and right channel. At 180°, the channels will be perfectly out of phase. Shape enables you to change the shape of the modulation waveform between a sine and a triangle.</p><p>Global parameters available include Rate, Amount, Feedback, Output, Warmth and Dry/Wet.</p><p>Rate sets the modulation rate in Hertz, and can be adjusted either with the dial or by dragging up or down in the display. Tip: Turn up Rate for a more drastic chorus sound, or keep it low for more gentle phasing.</p><p>Amount adjusts the amplitude of the modulation signals that affects delay times. Higher values result in a stronger time deviation from the unmodulated time setting.</p><p>Feedback sets the amount of each channel’s output that is fed back to its input. Increasing this sounds more extreme and tends to increase upper harmonic material, and will also create audible delays if playback is stopped. The feedback signal can be inverted using the Ø button, which results in a “hollow” sound when combined with high feedback values.</p><p>Output sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal.</p><p>Warmth adds slight distortion and filtering for a warmer sound.

Compression reduces the levels of peaks, opening up more headroom and allowing the overall signal level to be turned up. This gives the signal a higher average level, resulting in a sound that is subjectively louder and ”punchier” than an uncompressed signal.</p><p>A compressor’s two most important parameters are the Threshold and the compression Ratio.</p><p>The Threshold slider sets where compression begins. Signals above the threshold are attenuated by an amount specified by the Ratio parameter, which sets the ratio between the input and output signal. For example, with a compression ratio of 3, if a signal above the threshold increases by 3 dB, the compressor output will increase by only 1 dB. If a signal above the threshold increases by 6 dB, then the output will increase by only 2 dB. A ratio of 1 means no compression, regardless of the threshold.</p><p>The orange Gain Reduction meter shows how much the gain is being reduced at any given moment. The more reduction, the more audible the effect; a gain reduction above 6 dB or so might produce the desired loudness, but significantly alters the sound and is easily capable of destroying its dynamic structure. This is something that cannot be undone in later production steps. Keep this in mind especially when using a compressor, limiter or sound loudness-maximizing tool in the master channel. Less is often more here.</p><p>Because compression reduces the volume of loud signals and opens up headroom, you can use the Output (Out) control so that the peaks once again hit the maximum available headroom. The Output meter shows the output signal’s level. Enabling the Makeup button automatically compensates the output level if the threshold and ratio settings change.</p><p>Dry/Wet adjusts the balance between the compressed and uncompressed signals. At 100%, only the compressed signal is heard, while at 0%, the device is effectively bypassed.</p><p>The Knee control adjusts how gradually or abruptly compression occurs as the threshold is approached. With a setting of 0 dB, no compression is applied to signals below the threshold, and full compression is applied to any signal at or above the threshold. With very high ratios, this so-called ”hard knee” behavior can sound harsh. With higher (or ”soft”) knee values, the compressor begins compressing gradually as the threshold is approached. For example, with a 10 dB knee and a -20 dB threshold, subtle compression will begin at -30 dB and increase so that signals at -10 dB will be fully compressed.</p><p>Compressor’s display can be switched between several modes via switches in the bottom corners of the display:</p><ul><li>The <em>Collapsed</em> view shows only the essential controls.</li></ul><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CompressorCollapsed.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Compressor’s Collapsed View</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The <em>Transfer Curve</em> shows the input level on the horizontal axis and output level vertically.

With Auto Release enabled, the release time will adjust automatically based on the incoming audio.</p><p>A slight amount of attack time (10-50 ms) allows peaks to come through unprocessed, which helps preserve dynamics by accentuating the initial portion of the signal. If these peaks cause overloads, you can try shortening the attack time, but extremely short times take the ”life” out of the signal, and may lead to a slight “buzziness” caused by distortion. Short release times can cause ”pumping” as the compressor tries to figure out whether to compress or not; while generally considered an undesirable effect, some engineers use it on full drum kits to give unusual ”sucking” effects. Careful adjustment of attack and release times is essential when it comes to compression of rhythmical sources. If you are not used to working with compressors, play a drum loop and spend some time adjusting Attack, Release, Threshold and Gain. It can be very exciting!</p><p>A compressor can only react to an input signal once it occurs. Since it also needs to apply an attack/release envelope, the compression is always a bit too late. A digital compressor can solve this problem by simply delaying the input signal a little bit. Compressor offers three different Lookahead times: zero ms, one ms and ten ms. The results may sound pretty different depending on this setting.</p><p>Compressor can be switched between three basic modes of operation. With Peak selected, Compressor reacts to short peaks within a signal. This mode is more aggressive and precise, and so works well for limiting tasks where you need to ensure that there are absolutely no signals over the set threshold. RMS mode causes Compressor to be less sensitive to very short peaks and compress only when the incoming level has exceeded the threshold for a slightly longer time. RMS is closer to how people actually perceive loudness and is usually considered more ”musical.”</p><p>In Expand mode, the Ratio can also be set to values <em>below</em> 1. In this state, Compressor acts as an upward expander, and will <em>increase</em> the gain when signals exceed the threshold. (For more information about the various types of dynamics processing, see the Multiband Dynamics chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#multiband-dynamics">‘Multiband Dynamics’</a>).)</p><p>In addition to these modes, Compressor can be switched between two envelope follower shapes that offer further options for how the device measures and responds to signal levels. In linear (Lin) mode, the speed of the compression response is determined entirely by the Attack and Release values. In logarithmic (Log) mode, sharply compressed peaks will have a faster release time than less compressed material. This can result in smoother and less noticeable compression than Lin mode. Note that the Lin/Log switch is not visible in Compressor’s collapsed view.</p><section id="sidechain-parameters" data-number="1.9.1"><h3 data-number="25.9.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.9.1</span> Sidechain Parameters</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CompressorSidechain.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Compressor Device With Sidechain Section.</figcaption></figure><p>Normally, the signal being compressed and the input source that triggers the compressor are the same signal. But by using <em>sidechaining</em>, it is possible to compress a signal based on the level of another signal or a specific frequency component. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Compressor window by toggling the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_fold1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in its title bar.</p><p>The sidechain parameters are divided into two sections.

This causes the selected source to act as the compressor’s trigger, instead of the signal that is actually being compressed.</p><p>The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the compressor’s trigger. With Dry/Wet at 100%, the compressor is triggered entirely by the sidechain source. At 0%, the sidechain is effectively bypassed. Note that increasing the gain does <em>not</em> increase the volume of the source signal in the mix. The sidechain audio is only a trigger for the compressor and is never actually heard.</p><p>Note that automatic Makeup is not available when using external sidechain.</p><p>On the right of the external section are the controls for the sidechain EQ. Enabling this section causes the compressor to be triggered by a specific band of frequencies, instead of a complete signal. These can either be frequencies in the compressed signal or, by using the EQ in conjunction with an external sidechain, frequencies in another track’s audio.</p><p>The headphones button between the external and EQ sections allows you to listen to only the sidechain input, bypassing the compressor’s output.

In this case, insert the Compressor on the track you want to duck. Then choose the drum track as the external sidechain source. Then enable the sidechain EQ and select the low-pass filter. By carefully adjusting the Frequency and Q settings, you should be able to isolate the kick drum from the rest of the drum mix.

If multiple notes are held simultaneously, the Last/Low switch determines whether the last or the lowest note will have priority. The Transpose and Fine knobs in the Resonator section (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#resonator-parameters">‘Resonator Parameters’</a>) allow for coarse and fine offset of the MIDI-modulated tuning.

The slider below the switch determines the extent to which MIDI note off messages mute the resonance. At 0%, note offs are ignored, and the decay time is based only on the value of the Decay parameter, which can be adjusted using the X-Y controller or Decay slider.

The numbered switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example, selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay.</p><p>If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. In this case, to edit the delay time, click and drag up the Delay Time knob.</p><p>With Stereo Link engaged, the left channel’s settings are applied to the right channel, and changing either channel’s Sync switch or Delay Time settings will apply the changes to both sides.</p><p>The Feedback parameter defines how much of each channel’s output signal feeds back into the delay lines’ inputs. Internally, they are two independent feedback loops, so a signal on the left channel does not feed back into the right channel and vice versa.</p><p>The <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/FreezeButtonInactive.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=58"></span> button will cause the delay to endlessly cycle the audio which is in its buffer at the moment that the button is pressed, ignoring any new input until Freeze is disabled.</p><p>The delay is preceded by a band-pass filter that can be toggled on and off with a switch, and controlled with an X-Y controller. To define the filter bandwidth, click and drag on the vertical axis. To set the position of the frequency band, click and drag on the horizontal axis.</p><p>Filter frequency and delay time can be modulated by an LFO, making it possible to achieve a range of sounds from light chorus-like effects through to heavy contorted noise. The Rate slider sets the frequency of the modulation oscillator in Hertz. The Filter slider adjusts the amount of modulation that is applied to the filter, and the Time slider adjusts the amount of modulation that is applied to the delay time.</p><p>Changing the delay time while Delay is processing audio can cause abrupt changes in the sound of the delayed signal. You can choose between three delay transition modes:</p><ul><li>Repitch causes a pitch variation when changing the delay time, similar to the behavior of old tape delay units. Repitch mode is the default option.</li><li>Fade creates a crossfade between the old and new delay times. This sounds a bit similar to time stretching if the delay time is gradually changed.</li><li>Jump immediately jumps to the new delay time. Note that this will cause an audible click if the delay time is changed while delays are sounding.</li></ul><p>Tip: try using the Time slider to explore the effect of time modulation on the different transition modes.</p><p>When the Ping Pong switch is activated, the signal jumps from the left to the right output.</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100 percent when using Delay in a return track. The Dry/Wet parameter’s context menu lets you toggle Equal-Loudness.

The compressor is optimized for balancing out groups of drums, with fast attack, medium release and moderate ratio settings, as well as ample makeup gain.</p><p>There are three types of distortion which can be applied to the input signal. Each distortion type adds an increasing degree of distortion, while lending its own character to the overall sound:</p><ul><li>Soft: waveshaping distortion</li><li>Medium: limiting distortion</li><li>Hard: clipping distortion with bass boost</li></ul><p>For more intensity, it is possible to drive the input prior to distorting it. The Drive control lets you determine how much drive is applied to the input signal.</p><p>Drum Buss combines commonly-used drum processing tools for shaping the mid-high range and filling out the low end, which we will look at in the following sections.</p><section id="mid-high-frequency-shaping" data-number="1.12.0.1"><h4 data-number="25.12.0.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.12.0.1</span> Mid-High Frequency Shaping</h4><p>The mid-high frequency shaping tools are designed to add clarity and presence to drums such as snares and hi-hats.</p><p>Crunch adjusts the amount of sine-shaped distortion applied to mid-high frequencies.</p><p>The Damp control is a low-pass filter, which removes unwanted high frequencies that can occur after adding distortion.</p><p>The Transients knob emphasizes or de-emphasizes the transients of frequencies above 100 Hz. Positive values add attack and increase sustain, resulting in a full, “punchy” sound. Negative values also add attack, but decrease sustain. This tightens up the drums, giving them a sharper, more crisp sound with less room and rattle.</p><p>Low-End Enhancement</p><p>Drum Buss’s low-end enhancement is made up of two tools: a resonant filter, which dramatically boosts bass frequencies, as well as a Decay control, which allows you to adjust the decay rate of both the incoming audio and the signal processed by the resonant filter. These tools help you to fill out the low-end of your drums.</p><p>The Boom knob adjusts the amount of low-end enhancement that the resonant filter produces. The Bass Meter lets you see the Boom’s effect on the signal, which can be particularly useful if you can’t hear it.</p><p>The Freq knob adjusts the frequency of the low-end enhancer. Force To Note lets you tune the low-end enhancer by setting its frequency to the value of the nearest MIDI note.</p><p>The Decay control adjusts the decay rate of the low frequencies. When the Boom amount is set to 0%, the decay affects the incoming (post-drive and distortion) signal only. When the “Boom Level” is adjusted above 0%, the decay affects both the incoming and processed signals.</p><p>To solo the result of the low-frequency enhancer, enable Boom Audition via the headphone icon.</p></section><section id="output" data-number="1.12.0.2"><h4 data-number="25.12.0.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.12.0.2</span> Output</h4><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.</p><p>The Output Gain slider sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal.</p></section></section><section id="dynamic-tube" data-number="1.13"><h2 data-number="25.13"><span class="header-section-number">25.13</span> Dynamic Tube</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/DynamicTube.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Dynamic Tube Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Dynamic Tube effect is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</p><p>The Dynamic Tube effect infuses sounds with the peculiarities of tube saturation. An integrated envelope follower generates dynamic tonal variations related to the level of the input signal.</p><p>Three tube models, A, B and C, provide a range of distortion characteristics known from real amplifier tubes. Tube A does not produce distortions if Bias is set low, but will kick in whenever the input signal exceeds a certain threshold, creating bright harmonics. Tube C is a very poor tube amp that produces distortions all the time. The qualities of Tube B lie somewhere between these two extremes.</p><p>The Tone control sets the spectral distribution of the distortions, directing them into the higher registers, or through the midrange and deeper.</p><p>The Drive control determines how much signal reaches the tube; greater Drive yields a dirtier output. The intensity of the tube is controlled by the Bias dial, which pushes the signal into the celebrated realms of nonlinear distortion. With very high amounts of Bias, the signal will really start to break apart.</p><p>The Bias parameter can be positively or negatively modulated by an envelope follower, which is controlled with the Envelope knob. The more deeply the envelope is applied, the more the Bias point will be influenced by the level of the input signal. Negative Envelope values create expansion effects by reducing distortion on loud signals, while positive values will make loud sounds dirtier.</p><p>Attack and Release are envelope characteristics that define how quickly the envelope reacts to volume changes in the input signal. Together, they shape the dynamic nature of the distortions. Note that if Envelope is set to zero, they will have no effect.</p><p>Cut or boost the device’s final signal level with the Output dial.</p><p>Aliasing can be reduced by enabling Hi-Quality mode, which can be accessed via the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu.

Stereo mode uses a single curve to filter both channels of a stereo input equally. L/R mode provides an independently adjustable filter curve for the left and right channels of a stereo input; M/S mode (Mid/Side) provides the same functionality for signals that have been recorded using M/S encoding.

This means that you can completely remove, for example, the bass drum or bassline of a track, while leaving the other frequencies untouched.</p><p>You can also turn on or off each band using the On/Off buttons located under the gain controls. These buttons are especially handy if assigned to computer keys.</p><p>EQ Three gives you visual confirmation of the presence of a signal in each frequency band using three LEDs. Even if a band is turned off, you can tell if there is something going on in it. The internal threshold for the LEDs is set to -24 dB.</p><p>The frequency range of each band is defined via two crossover controls: FreqLo and FreqHi. If FreqLo is set to 500 Hz and FreqHi to 2000 Hz, then the low band goes from 0 Hz to 500 Hz, the mid band from 500 Hz to 2000 Hz and the high band from 2000 Hz up to whatever your soundcard or sample rate supports.</p><p>A very important control is the 24 dB/48 dB switch. It defines how sharp the filters are cutting the signal at the crossover frequency. The higher setting results in more drastic filtering, but needs more CPU.</p><p>Note: The filters in this device are optimized to sound more like a good, powerful analog filter cascade than a clean digital filter. The 48 dB Mode especially does not provide a perfect linear transfer quality, resulting in a slight coloration of the input signal even if all controls are set to 0.00 dB. This is typical behavior for this kind of filter, and is part of EQ Three’s unique sound. If you need a more linear behavior choose 24 dB Mode or use the EQ Eight.</p></section><section id="erosion" data-number="1.17"><h2 data-number="25.17"><span class="header-section-number">25.17</span> Erosion</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Erosion.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=316"><figcaption>The Erosion Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>The Erosion effect degrades the input signal by modulating a short delay with filtered noise or a sine wave. This adds noisy artifacts or aliasing/downsampling-like distortions that sound very ”digital.”</p><p>To change the sine wave frequency or noise band center frequency, click and drag along the X-axis in the X-Y field. The Y-axis controls the modulation amount. If you hold down the <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) modifier key while clicking in the X-Y field, the Y-axis controls the bandwidth.

Lower values lead to more selective distortion frequencies, while higher values affect the entire input signal.

Instead of processing audio itself, it allows you to use <em>external</em> (hardware) effects processors within a track’s device chain.</p><p>The Audio To chooser selects the outputs on your computer’s audio hardware that will go to your external device, while the Audio From chooser selects the inputs that will bring the processed signal back into Live. As with the track inputs and outputs, the list of available inputs and outputs depends on the Audio Preferences, which can be reached via the ”Configure…” option at the bottom of each chooser.</p><p>Below each chooser is a Peak level indicator that shows the highest audio level attained. Click on the indicators to reset them.</p><p>The Gain knobs next to the choosers adjust the levels going out of and back into Live. These levels should be set carefully to avoid clipping, both in your external hardware and when returning the audio to your computer.</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100 percent if using the External Audio Effect in a return track.</p><p>The Invert button inverts the phase of the processed signal coming back into Live.</p><p>Since hardware effects introduce latency that Live cannot automatically detect, you can manually compensate for any delays by adjusting the Hardware Latency slider. The button next to this slider allows you to set your latency compensation amount in either milliseconds or samples. If your external device connects to Live via a digital connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in samples, which ensures that the number of samples you specify will be retained even when changing the sample rate. If your external device connects to Live via an analog connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in milliseconds, which ensures that the amount of time you specify will be retained when changing the sample rate. Note that adjusting in samples gives you finer control, so even in cases when you’re working with analog devices, you may want to ”fine tune” your latency in samples in order to achieve the lowest possible latency. In this case, be sure to switch back to milliseconds before changing your sample rate.</p><p>Note: If the Delay Compensation option (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#device-delay-compensation">‘Device Delay Compensation’</a>) is unchecked in the Options menu, the Hardware Latency slider is disabled.</p><p>For instructions on how to accurately set up latency compensation for your hardware, please see the ”Driver Error Compensation” lesson.</p></section><section id="filter-delay" data-number="1.19"><h2 data-number="25.19"><span class="header-section-number">25.19</span> Filter Delay</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/FilterDelay.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Filter Delay Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Filter Delay effect is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</p><p>The Filter Delay provides three independent delay lines, each preceded by linked low-pass and high-pass filters. This allows applying delay to only certain input signal frequencies, as determined by the filter settings. The feedback from each of the three delays is also routed back through the filters.</p><p>Each of the three delays can be switched on and off independently. The Filter Delay device assigns delay 1 to the input signal’s left channel, delay 2 to the left and right channels and delay 3 to the right channel. The Pan controls at the right can override the delay channels’ outputs; otherwise each delay outputs on the channel from which it derives its input.</p><p>Each delay channel’s filter has an associated On switch, located to the left of each X-Y controller. The X-Y controllers adjust the low-pass and high-pass filters simultaneously for each delay. To edit filter bandwidth, click and drag on the vertical axis; click and drag on the horizontal axis to set the filter band’s frequency.</p><p>To refer delay time to the song tempo, activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time beat division chooser. The numbered switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example, selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay. With Sync Mode active, changing the Delay Time field percentage value shortens and extends delay times by fractional amounts, thus producing the ”swing” type of timing effect found in drum machines.</p><p>If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. In this case, to edit the delay time, click and drag up or down in the Delay Time field, or click in the field and type in a value.</p><p>The Feedback parameter sets how much of the output signal returns to the delay line input. Very high values can lead to runaway feedback and produce a loud oscillation — watch your ears and speakers if you decide to check out extreme feedback settings!</p><p>Each delay channel has its own volume control, which can be turned up to +12 dB to compensate for drastic filtering at the input.</p><p>The Dry control adjusts the unprocessed signal level.

Frequency Shifter is no longer part of the Core Library as of 11.1 but can still be found in the User Library. Live Sets that were made in earlier versions, e.g. 11.0.10,  that contain Frequency Shifter will still open with that specific device in 11.1 and later.</p><p>The Frequency Shifter moves the frequencies of incoming audio up or down by a user-specified amount in Hertz. Small amounts of shift can result in subtle tremolo or phasing effects, while large shifts can create dissonant, metallic sounds.</p><p>The Coarse and Fine knobs set the amount of shift that will be applied to the input. For example, if the input is a sine wave at 440 Hz and the frequency is set to 100 Hz, the output will be a sine wave at 540 Hz.</p><p>By changing the Mode from Shift to Ring, Frequency Shifter switches from classical frequency shifting to <em>ring modulation</em>. In Ring mode, the selected frequency amount is added to <em>and</em> subtracted from the input. For example, if the incoming audio signal (A) is a sine wave at 440 Hz and the Frequency is set to 100 Hz (B), the output will contain partials at 340 Hz (A-B) and 540 Hz (A+B).</p><p>The Drive button enables a distortion effect, while the slider below it controls the level of the distortion. Drive is only available in Ring mode.</p><p>Enabling the Wide button creates a stereo effect by inverting the polarity of the Spread value for the right channel. This means that increasing the Spread value will shift the frequency down in the right channel while shifting it up in the left. Note that Wide has no effect if the Spread value is set to 0.</p><p>Frequency Shifter contains two LFOs to modulate the frequency for the left and right stereo channels.

This knob is called Mix when Drive is enabled. Note that the Drive effect is post-Mix, which means that you can use Frequency Shifter as a pure distortion effect by enabling Drive and setting Mix to 0%.</p><p>Frequency shifting is accomplished by simply adding or subtracting a value in Hertz to the incoming audio. This is distinct from <em>pitch shifting</em>, in which the ratios of the incoming frequencies (and thus their harmonic relationships) are preserved. For example, imagine you have an incoming audio signal consisting of sine waves an octave apart at 440 Hz and 880 Hz. To pitch shift this up an octave, we multiply these frequencies by two, resulting in new frequencies at 880 Hz and 1760 Hz.</p><section id="frequency-shifter-tips" data-number="1.21.1"><h3 data-number="25.21.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.21.1</span> Frequency Shifter Tips</h3><p>Frequency shifting and ring modulation can produce some very interesting sounds.

Using a sampler’s transposition controls often changes the character of the sounds in unrealistic ways, resulting in ”pinched” or ”tubby” samples. Frequency shifting can be a useful alternative.</p><p>Try using the device in Shift mode with the Dry/Wet amount at 100%. Then adjust the Fine frequency no more than about 100 Hz up or down. This should change the apparent size and tuning of the drum while retaining the quality of the original sample.</p></section><section id="phasing" data-number="1.21.1.2"><h4 data-number="25.21.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.21.1.2</span> Phasing</h4><p>To create lush phasing effects, try using extremely small amounts of shift (no more than about 2 Hz).

A gate can eliminate low-level noise that occurs between sounds (e.g., hiss or hum), or shape a sound by turning up the threshold so that it cuts off reverb or delay tails or truncates an instrument’s natural decay.</p><p>As of Live 9, Gate’s internal behavior has been subtly improved. Although it works more “correctly” than it did in previous Live versions, Live Sets that use Gate and which were made prior to Live 9 may sound slightly different. To ensure that older Sets sound exactly the same, the Gate Legacy Mode option will be enabled by default when loading an old Set that uses Gate. You can disable this via a <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu entry in Gate’s title bar.</p><p>Gate’s display area shows the level of the input signal in light gray and the level of the output signal in a darker gray with a white outline. This allows you to see the amount of gating that is occurring at any moment, and helps you to set the appropriate parameters.</p><p>The Threshold knob sets the gate’s sensitivity. The Threshold value is represented in the display as a horizontal blue line, which can also be dragged.</p><p>Return (also known as “hysteresis”) sets the difference between the level that opens the gate and the level that closes it. Higher hysteresis values reduce “chatter” caused by the gate rapidly opening and closing when the input signal is near the threshold level. The Return value is represented in the display as an additional horizontal orange line.</p><p>With the Flip button enabled, the gate works in reverse; the signal will only pass if its level is below the threshold.</p><p>A gate can only react to an input signal once it occurs. Since it also needs to apply an attack/release envelope, the gating is always a bit too late. A digital gate can solve this problem by simply delaying the input signal a little bit. Gate offers three different Lookahead times: zero ms, one ms and ten ms. The results may sound pretty different depending on this setting.</p><p>The Attack time determines how long it takes for the gate to switch from closed to open when a signal goes from below to above the threshold. Very short attack times can produce sharp clicking sounds, while long times soften the sound’s attack.</p><p>When the signal goes from above to below the threshold, the Hold time kicks in. After the hold time expires, the gate closes over a period of time set by the Release parameter.</p><p>The Floor knob sets the amount of attenuation that will be applied when the gate is closed. If set to -inf dB, a closed gate will mute the input signal. A setting of 0.00 dB means that even if the gate is closed, there is no effect on the signal. Settings in between these two extremes attenuate the input to a greater or lesser degree when the gate is closed.</p><p>Normally, the signal being gated and the input source that triggers the gate are the same signal. But by using <em>sidechaining</em>, it is possible to gate a signal based on the level of another signal. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Gate window by toggling the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_fold.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in its title bar.</p><p>Enabling this section with the Sidechain button allows you to select another track from the choosers below. This causes the selected track’s signal to act as the gate’s trigger, instead of the signal that is actually being gated.</p><p>The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the gate’s trigger. With Dry/Wet at 100%, the gate is triggered entirely by the sidechain source. At 0%, the sidechain is effectively bypassed. Note that increasing the gain does <em>not</em> increase the volume of the source signal in the mix. The sidechain audio is only a trigger for the gate and is never actually heard.</p><p>Sidechain gating can be used to superimpose rhythmic patterns from one source onto another. For example, a held pad sound can be triggered with the rhythm of a drum loop by inserting a Gate on the pad’s track and choosing the drum loop’s track as the sidechain input.</p><p>On the right of the external section are the controls for the sidechain EQ. Enabling this section causes the gate to be triggered by a specific band of frequencies, instead of a complete signal. These can either be frequencies in the signal to be gated or, by using the EQ in conjunction with an external sidechain, frequencies in another track’s audio.</p><p>The headphones button between the external and EQ sections allows you to listen to only the sidechain input, bypassing the gate’s output. Since the sidechain audio isn’t fed to the output, and is only a trigger for the gate, this temporary listening option can make it much easier to set sidechain parameters and hear what’s actually making the gate work.

Like Live’s original Compressor (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#compressor">‘Compressor’</a>), the Glue Compressor can be used for basic dynamics control of individual tracks, but is mainly designed for use on the Main track or a Group Track to “glue” multiple sources together into a cohesive sounding mix.</p><p>The Threshold knob sets where compression begins. Signals above the threshold are attenuated by an amount specified by the Ratio parameter, which sets the ratio between the input and output signal. Unlike the Compressor, the Glue Compressor does not have a user-adjustable knee. Instead, the knee becomes more sharp as the ratio increases.</p><p>Attack defines how long it takes to reach maximum compression once a signal exceeds the threshold. The Attack knob’s values are in milliseconds. Release sets how long it takes for the compressor to return to normal operation after the signal falls below the threshold. The Release knob’s values are in seconds. When Release is set to A (Auto), the release time will adjust automatically based on the incoming audio. The Glue Compressor’s Auto Release actually uses two times - a slow one as a base compression value, and a fast one to react to transients in the signal. Auto Release may be too slow to react to sudden changes in level, but generally is a useful way to tame a wide range of material in a gentle way.</p><p>Dry/Wet adjusts the balance between the compressed and uncompressed signals. At 100%, only the compressed signal is heard, while at 0%, the device is effectively bypassed. Another way of controlling the amount of compression is with the Range slider, which sets how much compression can occur. Values between about -60 and -70 dB emulate the original hardware, while values between -40 and -15 dB can be useful as an alternative to the Dry/Wet control. At 0 dB, no compression occurs.</p><p>Makeup applies gain to the signal, allowing you to compensate for the reduction in level caused by compression. A Makeup value that roughly corresponds to the position of the needle in the display should result in a level close to what you had before compressing.</p><p>The Soft clip switch toggles a fixed waveshaper, useful for taming very loud transients. When enabled, the Glue Compressor’s maximum output level is -.5 dB. (Note that with Oversampling enabled, very loud peaks may still exceed 0 dB.) The Soft clipper is not a transparent limiter, and will distort your signal when active. We recommend leaving it disabled unless this particular type of “colored” distortion is what you’re looking for.</p><p>The Glue Compressor’s needle display shows the amount of gain reduction in dB. The Clip LED turns red if the device’s output level is exceeding 0 dB. If Soft clipping is enabled, this LED turns yellow to indicate that peaks are being clipped.</p><section id="sidechain-parameters-2" data-number="1.23.1"><h3 data-number="25.23.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.23.1</span> Sidechain Parameters</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/GlueSidechain.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Glue Compressor With Sidechain Section.</figcaption></figure><p>Normally, the signal being compressed and the input source that triggers the compressor are the same signal.

To assign a parameter to the Y-axis, use the parameter row on the left side.</p><p>To refer delay time to the song tempo, activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time beat division chooser. The numbered switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example, selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay. With Sync Mode active, changing the Delay Time field percentage value shortens and extends delay times by fractional amounts, thus producing the ”swing” type of timing effect found in drum machines.</p><p>If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. In this case, to edit the delay time, click and drag up or down in the Delay Time field, or click in the field and type in a value.</p><p>The Delay Time can also be routed to the horizontal axis of the X-Y controller.</p><p>The Spray control adds random delay time changes. Low values smear the signal across time, which adds ”noisiness” to the sound. High Spray values completely break down the structure of the source signal, introducing varying degrees of rhythmic chaos. This is the recommended setting for anarchists.</p><p>The size and duration of each grain is a function of the Frequency parameter. The sound of Pitch and Spray depends very much on this parameter.</p><p>You can transpose the grain pitch with the Pitch parameter, which acts much like a crude pitch shifter.</p><p>The Random Pitch control adds random variations to each grain’s pitch. Low values create a sort of mutant chorusing effect, while high values can make the original source pitch completely unintelligible. This parameter can interact with the main Pitch control, thus allowing degrees of stability and instability in a sound’s pitch structure.</p><p>The Feedback parameter sets how much of the output signal returns to the delay line input. Very high values can lead to runaway feedback and produce a loud oscillation — watch your ears and speakers if you decide to check out extreme feedback settings!</p><p>Grain Delay also has a dry/wet control, which can be routed to the vertical axis of the X-Y controller.</p></section><section id="hybrid-reverb" data-number="1.25"><h2 data-number="25.25"><span class="header-section-number">25.25</span> Hybrid Reverb</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/HybridReverb.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Hybrid Reverb Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Hybrid Reverb effect is not available in the Intro, Lite and Standard Editions.)</p><p>Hybrid Reverb combines two different approaches to reverberation in one device, blending convolution reverb with a number of digital reverb algorithms. Using multiple routing options and parameters, you can create unique reverb sounds, or use Hybrid Reverb to generate drone-like soundscapes or completely transform any source material.</p><p>In addition to providing a selection of impulse responses, Hybrid Reverb allows you to import any audio file to use as an impulse response (also known as an IR), greatly increasing your sound design opportunities. Dedicated controls can be employed to shape any chosen impulse response.</p><p>The algorithmic engine contains several reverb modes, each providing a different set of parameters and sonic properties, ranging from clean and creamy to metallic and gong-like.</p><p>The convolution and algorithmic engines can be used independently, or combined together in series or parallel, with their volume relationship being continuously adjustable. An EQ section further shapes the reverb’s sound and can be selectively applied to the two reverb engines. An additional control introduces degradation of the signal, emulating the behavior of older digital reverb units.</p><section id="signal-flow" data-number="1.25.1"><h3 data-number="25.25.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.25.1</span> Signal Flow</h3><p>You can imagine signals being processed by Hybrid Reverb as flowing from the left side of the device towards the right side, passing first through the input section, then into the reverb engines. The relationship between the two reverb engines is affected by the routing section, after which the signal passes through the EQ section, and then finally to the output.</p><p>The convolution reverb engine’s controls are yellow in color, while the algorithmic engine’s controls are displayed in blue.</p></section><section id="input-section" data-number="1.25.2"><h3 data-number="25.25.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.25.2</span> Input Section</h3><p>Using the Send knob, you can choose the amount of gain applied to the signal that feeds the reverb. Note that the dry signal is not affected and will still pass through the device.</p><p>Predelay controls the delay time before the onset of the first early reflection. This delays the reverberation relative to the input signal. One’s impression of the size of a real room depends partly on this delay; typical values for “natural” sounds range from 1ms to 25ms. You can choose either a time-based or beat-synced predelay time using the Predelay Sync buttons.</p><p>Feedback sets the amount of the predelay’s output that is fed back to its input. Note that both time-based and beat-based predelay times have independent feedback settings.</p><p>The main window of Hybrid Reverb has two tabs: Reverb and EQ. The Reverb tab contains all controls related to both the convolution and algorithmic reverb engines. Starting with the Routing chooser in the center, you’ll find four options:</p><ul><li>Serial routes the output of the convolution engine into the algorithmic engine. While the convolution reverb is always active in this mode, Blend controls the amount of convolution reverb fed into the algorithmic reverb. A setting of 100/0 produces pure convolution reverb, while 0/100 generates pure algorithmic reverb which has been fed by the convolution reverb’s output.</li><li>Parallel uses both convolution and algorithmic reverb engines, but separates them from each other. The Blend knob adjusts the level balance between the two different reverb engines, with a setting of 100/0 generating pure convolution reverb and 0/100 producing pure algorithmic reverb.</li><li>Algorithm uses only the algorithmic reverb engine.</li><li>Convolution uses only the convolution reverb engine.</li></ul><p>Hybrid Reverb’s user interface changes dynamically, so that when a reverb engine is not in use, its controls will appear grayed out.</p><p>The Blend knob blends between the output of the convolution and algorithm sections when Routing is set to Serial or Parallel. Note that when either Algorithm or Convolution is selected in the Routing chooser, the Blend knob will not have an effect.</p></section><section id="convolution-reverb-engine" data-number="1.25.3"><h3 data-number="25.25.3"><span class="header-section-number">25.25.3</span> Convolution Reverb Engine</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/HybridReverbConvolutionSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Hybrid Reverb’s Convolution Reverb Section.</figcaption></figure><p>A convolution reverb uses recordings of actual spaces (called impulse responses) to create its effect. This allows you to place your sounds in practically any space for which you have a recording. For a more typical reverb sound, this can include some of the most famous halls and studios throughout the world. With a more creative approach, you can use recordings of anything, from snare drums to garbage cans, or even instrumental and vocal recordings!</p><p>Impulse responses can be chosen in the Convolution IR menu. The upper drop-down menu chooses the category of impulse response, while the lower drop-down menu chooses a specific impulse response from within that category. Backward and forward arrow buttons are provided for easy browsing through impulse responses. These arrow buttons will automatically switch to the next category when you reach the end of the current one, so you can continuously move through the impulse responses using the arrows alone. The chosen impulse response’s waveform is then shown in the main display, which changes based on the Attack, Decay, and Size settings (described below).</p><p>The various impulse response categories are: Early Reflections, Real Places, Chambers and Large Rooms, Made for Drums, Halls, Plates, Springs, Bigger Spaces, Textures, and User.</p><p>To add your own impulse responses to the User category, drag and drop the IR audio file into Hybrid Reverb’s convolution waveform display. If you add a file from a folder that contains other audio files, all files will be added as impulse responses. Note: if you remove Hybrid Reverb from a track and add it again, the previously added User samples will no longer be available in the User category. However, you can drag and drop the samples into the waveform display again to repopulate the list.</p><p>The Attack, Decay, and Size parameters control the impulse response’s amplitude envelope. The Attack parameter controls the attack time of the envelope, while the Decay parameter controls the decay time of the envelope. The Size parameter adjusts the relative size of the impulse response.</p></section><section id="algorithmic-reverb-engine" data-number="1.25.4"><h3 data-number="25.25.4"><span class="header-section-number">25.25.4</span> Algorithmic Reverb Engine</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/HybridReverbAlgorithmSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Hybrid Reverb’s Algorithmic Reverb Section.</figcaption></figure><p>In comparison to the convolution engine, the algorithmic engine is based purely on digital delay lines, and no samples are used.</p><p>To the right of the Blend knob you will find the controls for the algorithmic reverb engine. Different parameters will be displayed depending on what you choose in the Algorithm chooser.</p><p>Five different algorithms are available: Dark Hall, Quartz, Shimmer, Tides and Prism. For all algorithms, the Decay, Size, Delay and Freeze parameters are available.</p><p>Decay adjusts the approximate time required for the algorithm’s reverb tail to drop to 1/1000th (-60 dB) of its initial amplitude. Size controls the size of the virtual room. Delay sets an additional predelay time in milliseconds for the algorithm section.</p><p>The Freeze controls consist of two buttons, Freeze and Freeze In. Freeze disables any input to the reverb engine and sets the algorithm’s decay time to infinite, so that reverb output will sustain endlessly.

Low values produce sparser tails, while higher values produce denser tails. (Tip: turn this below 10% for dub-like delay effects. This is very fun to use on drums!)</li><li>Shimmer adjusts the intensity of the Shimmer effect. When disabled, there is no pitch shifting; when enabled, the level of the pitched signal becomes progressively more present as the value increases.

The low and high bands can be toggled between pass filters and shelving EQs. While in low-pass or high-pass mode, the filters provide a range of slopes, from a gentle 6 dB/octave to a steep 96 dB/octave. The two middle peak EQs can cover the entire frequency range and can be used for anything from wide-band boosting to semi-narrow cuts.</p></section><section id="output-section" data-number="1.25.6"><h3 data-number="25.25.6"><span class="header-section-number">25.25.6</span> Output Section</h3><p>Hybrid Reverb’s output section contains a final set of parameters to shape the device’s overall sound.</p><p>Stereo sets the stereo width of the wet signal. 0% yields a mono signal whereas values above 100% create a widened stereo panorama.</p><p>The Vintage slider increasingly degrades Hybrid Reverb’s sounds by emulating lower sample rates and bit-depths, as is common in vintage digital reverberation devices. Four presets can be used to radically alter the overall sound: Subtle, Old, Older, and Extreme.</p><p>Bass Mono converts frequencies lower than 180 Hz of Hybrid Reverb’s output signal to mono, which helps to make bass frequencies sound tighter.</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

Limiter is ideal for use in the Main track, to prevent clipping. A limiter is essentially a compressor with an infinite ratio. (For more information about compression theory, see the manual entry for the Compressor device (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#cabinet">‘Cabinet’</a>).)</p><p>The Gain knob allows you to boost or attenuate the incoming level before applying limiting.</p><p>Ceiling sets the absolute maximum level that the Limiter will output. If your incoming signal level has no peaks that are higher than the ceiling, Limiter will have no effect.</p><p>The Stereo / L/R switch determines how Limiter treats peaks that occur on only one side of the stereo signal. In L/R mode, Limiter functions as two separate limiters, with independent limiting for each channel. Stereo mode applies limiting to both channels whenever either of them has a peak that requires compression. L/R mode allows Limiter to apply more compression, but with some distortion of the stereo image.</p><p>The Lookahead chooser affects how quickly Limiter will respond to peaks that require compression. Shorter Lookahead times allow for more compression, but with an increase in distortion — particularly in the bass.</p><p>The Release knob adjusts how long it takes for Limiter to return to normal operation after the signal falls below the ceiling. With Auto enabled, Limiter analyzes the incoming signal and sets an appropriate release time automatically.</p><p>The meter gives a visual indication of how much gain reduction is being applied to the signal.</p><p>Note that any devices or channel faders that appear after Limiter may add gain. To ensure that your final output will never clip, place Limiter as the last device in the Main track’s device chain and keep your Master fader below 0 dB.</p></section><section id="looper" data-number="1.27"><h2 data-number="25.27"><span class="header-section-number">25.27</span> Looper</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Looper.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Looper Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Looper effect is not available in the Lite Edition.)</p><p>Looper is an audio effect based on classic real-time looping devices. It allows you to record and loop audio, creating endless overdubs that are synced to your Set. If the Set is not playing, Looper can analyze incoming audio and set Live’s tempo to match it. You can also predefine a loop length before recording and Live’s tempo will adjust so that your loop fits into the specified number of bars. Furthermore, audio can be imported to Looper to create a background for newly overdubbed material, or exported from Looper as a new clip.</p><p>The top half of Looper’s interface is a large display area optimized for easy readability during performance. During recording, the entire display area turns red. After recording, the display shows the current position in the loop and the total loop length in bars and beats.</p><p>Looper’s transport buttons work in a similar way to other transport controls in Live. The Record button records incoming audio until another button is pressed. This overwrites any audio currently stored in Looper. Overdub continues to add additional layers of incoming audio that are the length of the originally recorded material. The Play button plays back the current state of Looper’s buffer without recording any new material. The Stop button stops playback.</p><p>The behavior of the transport controls changes depending on whether or not Live’s playback is running. With the transport running, Looper behaves like a clip, and is subject to launch quantization as determined by the Quantization chooser (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-concepts/#recording-new-clips">‘Recording New Clips’</a>). When Live’s playback is stopped, Looper’s transport engages immediately, regardless of the Quantization setting.</p><p>The Clear button erases Looper’s buffer. If you press Clear in Overdub mode while the transport is running, the contents of the buffer are cleared but the tempo and length are maintained. Pressing Clear in any other mode resets the tempo and length.</p><p>The Undo button erases everything that you’ve overdubbed since the last time Overdub was enabled. Your original recording, and anything that was overdubbed in a previous pass, is preserved. After pressing Undo, the button changes to Redo, which replaces the material removed by the last undo.</p><p>The large button below the transport controls is the Multi-Purpose Transport Button. As with the normal transport buttons, this button’s behavior changes depending on Looper’s current playback state, and whether or not material has already been recorded. If the buffer is empty, a single click starts recording. If Looper is recording, overdubbing or stopped, a single click switches to play mode. During playback, a click switches to overdub mode, allowing you to toggle back and forth between overdub and playback via additional single clicks.</p><p>Quickly pressing the button twice stops Looper, from either play or overdub mode. Clicking and holding the button for two seconds while in play mode activates Undo or Redo. Pressing and holding for two seconds while stopped clears Looper’s buffer.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/LooperPedalStates.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Diagram of Looper’s Multi-Purpose Transport Button Behavior</figcaption></figure><p>Looper’s Multi-Purpose Transport Button is optimized for use with a MIDI footswitch. To assign a footswitch, enter MIDI Map Mode (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/midi-and-key-remote-control/#assigning-midi-remote-control">‘Assigning MIDI Remote Control’</a>), click the button and then press your attached footswitch. Then exit MIDI Map Mode.</p><p>The Tempo Control chooser affects how Looper determines the tempo of recorded material:</p><ul><li><em>None</em>: Looper’s internal tempo is independent of Live’s global tempo.</li><li><em>Follow song tempo</em>: The speed of Looper’s playback will be adjusted so that the recorded material plays back at Live’s global tempo.</li><li><em>Set &amp; Follow song tempo</em>: Live’s global tempo will be adjusted to match the tempo of material recorded into Looper. Any subsequent changes to Live’s global tempo will adjust the speed of Looper’s playback so that the recorded material plays back at the new global tempo.</li></ul><p>The Record Length chooser is used to set the length of recorded material. Its behavior changes depending on whether or not Live’s global transport is running and, depending on the setting of the Tempo Control chooser, can set Live’s global tempo:</p><ul><li><em>Song running</em>: If Looper’s Record Length chooser is set to the default ”x bars,” Looper will record until you press another transport button. If you specify a fixed number of bars to record by selecting another option in the chooser, Looper will record for the specified time and then switch to Play or Overdub, as determined by the button next to this chooser.</li><li><em>Song not running</em>: If Looper’s Record Length chooser is set to the default ”x bars,” Looper will make a guess about the tempo of the material you’ve recorded as soon as you press Overdub, Play or Stop. But this might result in a tempo that’s twice or half as fast as you’d like. If you first specify a fixed number of bars, Looper’s tempo will adjust so that your recording fits into this time.</li></ul><p>The Song Control chooser determines how Looper’s transport controls will affect Live’s global transport:</p><ul><li><em>None</em> means that Looper’s transport controls have no effect on Live’s global transport.</li><li><em>Start Song</em> will start Live’s global transport whenever Looper enters Play or Overdub mode. Looper’s Stop button has no effect on the global transport.</li><li><em>Start &amp; Stop Song</em> locks Live’s global transport to Looper’s transport controls. Entering Play or Overdub mode will start Live’s transport, while pressing Looper’s Stop button will stop Live’s transport.</li></ul><p>Starting playback of Live’s transport via Looper will automatically adjust the playback position of any apps that are connected via Ableton Link (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi/#setting-up-link">‘Setting up Link’</a>). This ensures that those apps remain tempo synced, and also at the correct position in the musical phrase.</p><p>The ”×2” button doubles the length of Looper’s recording buffer. Any material that you’ve already recorded will simply be duplicated. This allows you to, for example, record a series of one-bar ideas, and then overlay a series of two-bar ideas. The length and tempo of Looper’s buffer is shown in the display area.</p><p>Similarly, the ”÷2” button cuts the length of the current buffer in half. The material in the currently playing half is kept, while the other half is discarded.</p><p>The ”Drag me!” area in the display allows you to export Looper’s buffer as a new audio file. You can drag and drop to the browser or directly to a track, creating a new clip. The newly created clip’s Warp mode will be set to Re-Pitch by default (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#re-pitch-mode">‘Re-Pitch Mode’</a>). You can also drag audio files to the ”Drag me!” area, which will replace the contents of Looper’s buffer. You can then use this material as a bed for further overdubs, for example.</p><p>The Speed knob adjusts Looper’s playback speed (and thus pitch). The up and down arrow buttons to the left are shortcuts to raise or lower the pitch by octaves (thus doubling or halving the playback speed). These buttons are subject to the Quantization chooser setting.</p><p>Enabling the Reverse button plays the previously recorded material backwards. Any material that you overdub after enabling Reverse will be played forward. Note that disabling Reverse will then swap this behavior; the original material will play forward again, while the material that was overdubbed while Reverse was enabled will play backwards. Engaging the Reverse button is subject to the Quantization chooser setting.</p><p>Feedback sets the amount of previously recorded signal that is fed back into Looper when overdubbing. When set to 100%, the previously recorded material will never decrease in volume. When set to 50%, it will be half as loud with each repetition. Any changes to the Feedback amount won’t take effect until the next repetition. Note that Feedback has no effect in Play mode; each repetition will be at the same volume.</p><p>The Input -&gt; Output chooser provides four options for monitoring Looper’s input:</p><ul><li><em>Always</em> allows the input signal to be heard regardless of Looper’s playing or recording state. You’ll typically want to choose Always when using Looper as an effect in a single track.</li><li><em>Never</em> means that the input signal will never be heard. You’ll typically want to choose Never when using Looper as an effect in a return track, where it may be fed by send levels from a variety of other tracks.</li><li><em>Rec/OVR</em> means that the input is only audible when recording or overdubbing, but not when Looper is in Play mode or stopped. This is useful for situations in which you are feeding audio to multiple tracks, each containing its own Looper. If each of these Loopers is controlled with its own foot pedal, you can switch the recording and playback state while playing an instrument, without having to worry about monitor settings.</li><li><em>Rec/OVR/Stop</em> allows the input signal to be heard except when Looper is in play mode.

Designed primarily as a mastering processor, Multiband Dynamics allows for upward and downward compression and expansion of up to three independent frequency bands, with adjustable crossover points and envelope controls for each band. Each frequency range has both an upper and lower threshold, allowing for two types of dynamics processing to be used simultaneously per band.</p><section id="dynamics-processing-theory" data-number="1.28.1"><h3 data-number="25.28.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.28.1</span> Dynamics Processing Theory</h3><p>To understand how to use the Multiband Dynamics device, it helps to understand the four different methods of manipulating dynamics.</p><p>When we use the term “compression,” we’re typically talking about lowering the level of signals that exceed a threshold. This is how Live’s Compressor (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#compressor">‘Compressor’</a>) works, and is more accurately called <em>downward compression</em> because it pushes loud signals down, thus reducing the dynamic range. But it is also possible to reduce a signal’s dynamic range by raising the levels of signals that are <em>below</em> a threshold. This much-less-common form of compression is called <em>upward compression</em>. As you can see from this diagram, employing either type of compression results in a signal with a smaller dynamic range than the original.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MultibandCompressionDiagram.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Downward and Upward Compression.</figcaption></figure><p>The opposite of compression is expansion. A typical expander lowers the levels of signals that are below a threshold. This is how Live’s Gate (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#gate">‘Gate’</a>) works, and is more accurately called <em>downward expansion</em> because it pushes quiet signals down, thus increasing the dynamic range. It is also possible to increase a signal’s dynamic range by raising the levels of signals that are <em>above</em> a threshold. Like upward compression, this technique is known as <em>upward expansion</em> and is much less common. This diagram shows that either type of expansion results in a signal with a larger dynamic range.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MultibandExpansionDiagram.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Downward and Upward Expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>To summarize:</p><ul><li>Downward compression (common): make loud signals quieter</li><li>Upward compression (uncommon): make quiet signals louder</li><li>Downward expansion (common): make quiet signals quieter</li><li>Upward expansion (uncommon): make loud signals louder</li></ul><p>The Multiband Dynamics device allows for all of these types of processing. In fact, because the device allows for incoming audio to be divided into three frequency bands, and each band has both an upper and lower threshold, a single instance of Multiband Dynamics can provide six types of dynamics processing simultaneously.</p></section><section id="interface-and-controls" data-number="1.28.2"><h3 data-number="25.28.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.28.2</span> Interface and Controls</h3><p>The High and Low buttons toggle the high and low bands on or off. With both bands off, the device functions as a single-band effect. In this case, only the Mid controls affect the incoming signal. The frequency sliders below the High and Low buttons adjust the crossovers that define the frequency ranges for each band. If the low frequency is set to 500 Hz and the high frequency is set to 2000 Hz, then the low band goes from 0 Hz to 500 Hz, the mid band from 500 Hz to 2000 Hz and the high band from 2000 Hz up to whatever your soundcard or sample rate supports.</p><p>Each band has activator and solo buttons. With the activator button disabled for a given band, its compression/expansion and gain controls are bypassed. Soloing a band mutes the others. The Input knobs boost or attenuate the level of each band before it undergoes dynamics processing, while the Output knobs to the right of the display adjust the levels of the bands after processing.</p><p>The display area provides a way of both visualizing your dynamics processing and adjusting the relevant compression and expansion behavior. For each band, the output level is represented by large bars, while the input level before processing is represented by small bars. With no processing applied, the input meters will be aligned with the top of the output meters. The scaling along the bottom of the display shows dB. As you adjust the gain or dynamics processing for a band, you can see how its output changes in comparison to its input.</p><p>As you move your mouse over the display, the cursor will change to a bracket as it passes over the edges of the blocks on the left or right side. These blocks represent the signal levels under the Below and over the Above thresholds, respectively. Dragging left or right on the edges of these blocks adjusts the threshold level. Holding down <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) while dragging a threshold will adjust the same threshold for all bands. Hold down <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) to simultaneously adjust the Above and Below thresholds for a single band. Holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging left or right allows you to adjust the threshold of a single band at a finer resolution.</p><p>As you mouse over the middle of the block, the cursor will change to an up-down arrow. Click and drag up or down to make the signal within the selected volume range louder or quieter. Holding down <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) while dragging up or down will adjust the volume of the same block for all bands. Hold down <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) to simultaneously adjust the Above and Below volumes for a single band. Holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging up or down allows you to adjust the volume of a single band at a finer resolution. Double-clicking within the region resets the volume to its default.</p><p>In technical terms, lowering the volume in the block above the Above threshold applies downward compression, while raising it applies upward expansion. Likewise, lowering the volume in the block below the Below threshold applies downward expansion, while raising it applies upward compression. In all cases, you are adjusting the ratio of the compressor or expander.</p><p>The thresholds and ratios of all bands can also be adjusted via the column to the right of the display. The ”T,” ”B” and ”A” buttons at the bottom right of the display area toggle between displaying the Time (attack and release), Below (threshold and ratio) and Above (threshold and ratio) for each band.</p><p>For the Above thresholds, Attack defines how long it takes to reach maximum compression or expansion once a signal exceeds the threshold, while Release sets how long it takes for the device to return to normal operation after the signal falls below the threshold.</p><p>For the Below thresholds, Attack defines how long it takes to reach maximum compression or expansion once a signal drops below the threshold, while Release sets how long it takes for the device to return to normal operation after the signal goes above the threshold.</p><p>With Soft Knee enabled, compression or expansion begins gradually as the threshold is approached.</p><p>The RMS/Peak switch also affects how quickly Multiband Dynamics responds to level changes. With Peak selected, the device reacts to short peaks within a signal. RMS mode causes it to be less sensitive to very short peaks and to begin processing only when the incoming level has crossed the threshold for a slightly longer time.</p><p>The global Output knob adjusts the overall output gain of the device.</p><p>The Time control scales the durations of all of the Attack and Release controls. This allows you to maintain the same relative envelope times, but make them all faster or slower by the same amount.</p><p>The Amount knob adjusts the intensity of the compression or expansion applied to all bands. At 0%, each compressor/expander has an effective ratio of 1, meaning that it has no effect on the signal.</p></section><section id="sidechain-parameters-3" data-number="1.28.3"><h3 data-number="25.28.3"><span class="header-section-number">25.28.3</span> Sidechain Parameters</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MultibandDynamicsSidechain.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Multiband Dynamics Device With Sidechain Section.</figcaption></figure><p>Normally, the signal being processed and the input source that triggers the device are the same signal. But by using <em>sidechaining</em>, it is possible to apply dynamics processing to a signal based on the level of another signal or a specific frequency component. To access the Sidechain parameters, unfold the Multiband Dynamics window by toggling the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_fold1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in its title bar.</p><p>Enabling the Sidechain button allows you to select any of Live’s internal routing points from the choosers below. This causes the selected source to act as the device’s trigger, instead of the signal that is actually being processed.</p><p>The Gain knob adjusts the level of the external sidechain’s input, while the Dry/Wet knob allows you to use a combination of sidechain and original signal as the trigger. With Dry/Wet at 100%, the device is triggered entirely by the sidechain source. At 0%, the sidechain is effectively bypassed. Note that increasing the gain does <em>not</em> increase the volume of the source signal in the mix. The sidechain audio is only a trigger for the device and is never actually heard.</p><p>The headphones button allows you to listen to only the sidechain input, bypassing the device’s output. Since the sidechain audio isn’t fed to the output, and is only a trigger for the device, this temporary listening option can make it much easier to set sidechain parameters and hear what’s actually making the device work.</p></section><section id="multiband-dynamics-tips" data-number="1.28.4"><h3 data-number="25.28.4"><span class="header-section-number">25.28.4</span> Multiband Dynamics Tips</h3><p>Multiband Dynamics is a feature-rich and powerful device, capable of up to six independent types of simultaneous processing.

Adjust the crossover points to suit your audio material, then apply downward compression (by dragging down in the upper blocks in the display or by setting the numerical ratios to values greater than 1.)</p></section><section id="de-essing" data-number="1.28.4.2"><h4 data-number="25.28.4.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.28.4.2</span> De-essing</h4><p>To remove ”harshness” caused by overly loud high frequency content, try enabling only the upper band and setting its crossover frequency to around 5 kHz. Then gradually adjust the threshold and ratio to apply subtle downward compression. It may help to solo the band to more easily hear the results of your adjustments. Generally, de-essing works best with fairly fast attack and release times.</p></section><section id="uncompression" data-number="1.28.4.3"><h4 data-number="25.28.4.3"><span class="header-section-number">25.28.4.3</span> Uncompression</h4><p>Mastering engineers are often asked to perform miracles, like adding punch and energy to a mix that has already been heavily compressed, and thus has almost no remaining transients. Most of the time, these mixes have also been heavily maximized, meaning that they also have no remaining headroom. Luckily, upward expansion can sometimes help add life back to such overly squashed material. To do this:</p><ol type="1"><li>Turn down the Input knob to provide some additional headroom.</li><li>Adjust the Above thresholds for the bands so that they’re below the highest peaks.</li><li>Add a small amount of upward expansion to each band. Be careful — excessive upward expansion can make transients very loud.</li><li>Carefully adjust the attack and release times for each band. Note that, unlike in typical downward compression, very fast attack times will <em>increase</em> the impact of transients, while slower times result in a more muffled sound.</li></ol><p><em>Note</em>: Adding a maximizer or limiter to boost gain after you’ve returned some peaks to your material may simply destroy them again.</p></section></section></section><section id="overdrive" data-number="1.29"><h2 data-number="25.29"><span class="header-section-number">25.29</span> Overdrive</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Overdrive.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=220"><figcaption>The Overdrive Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Overdrive effect is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</p><p>Overdrive is a distortion effect that pays homage to some classic pedal devices commonly used by guitarists.

In combination with Live’s Tuner (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#tuner">‘Tuner’</a>), Amp (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#amp">‘Amp’</a>) and Cabinet (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#cabinet">‘Cabinet’</a>) effects, Pedal is great for processing guitar sounds. Pedal can also be used in less conventional settings, such as a standalone effect on vocals, synths or drums.</p><p>The Gain control adjusts the amount of distortion applied to the dry signal. Note that 0% does not mean zero distortion. It is recommended to dial the Gain back to 0% and slowly increase it until you get the desired output level. When placed in front of Pedal in a device chain, Utility’s (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#utility">‘Utility’</a>) Gain parameter can be used to lower the signal even further.</p><p>The global Output knob adjusts the overall output gain of the device.</p><p>You can choose between three different Pedal Types, each inspired by distortion pedals with their own distinct sonic characteristics:</p><ul><li>Overdrive: warm and smooth</li><li>Distortion: tight and aggressive</li><li>Fuzz: unstable, with a “broken amp” sound</li></ul><p>Pedal has a three-band EQ that adjusts the timbre of the sound after the distortion is applied. The EQ is adaptive, which means that the amount of resonance (or “Q”) increases as the amount of EQ boost increases.</p><p>The Bass control is a peak EQ, with a center frequency of 100 Hz. This is useful for boosting the “punch” in bass or drum sounds, or attenuating low frequencies of guitars.</p><p>The Mid control is a three-way switchable boosting EQ. The Mid Frequency switch sets the center frequency and range of the Mid control. The center frequency is the middle of the frequency range that the Mid control operates upon. The frequency range around this center value is narrower in the lowest switch setting and wider in the higher setting. This is common in guitar pedals where it is normal to make tight cuts and boosts at low frequencies, and wider cuts and boosts at high frequencies.</p><p>The center frequencies for the switch settings are:</p><ul><li>Lowest setting, positioned on the left side: 500 Hz</li><li>Middle setting, positioned in the center: 1 kHz</li><li>Highest setting, positioned on the right side: 2 kHz</li></ul><p>The Treble control is a shelving EQ, with a cutoff frequency of 3.3 kHz. This is useful for removing harsh high frequencies (or boosting them, if that’s your cup of tea!).</p><p>Tip: for a more fine-grained EQ post-distortion, simply leave these controls in their neutral position and instead use another EQ, such as EQ Eight (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#eq-eight">‘EQ Eight’</a>).</p><p>The Sub switch toggles a low shelf filter that boosts frequencies below 250 Hz. You can use this in conjunction with the Bass control by turning Sub on and setting the Bass to -100%, or turning Sub off and setting the Bass to 100%.</p><p>The Dry/Wet slider adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.</p><p>Aliasing can be reduced by enabling Hi-Quality mode, which can be accessed via the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu. This improves the sound quality, particularly with high frequency signals, but there is a slight increase in CPU usage.</p><section id="pedal-tips" data-number="1.30.1"><h3 data-number="25.30.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.30.1</span> Pedal Tips</h3><section id="positioning-pedal-in-the-device-chain" data-number="1.30.1.1"><h4 data-number="25.30.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.30.1.1</span> Positioning Pedal in the Device Chain</h4><p>The incoming signal will have an impact on how the distortion will respond.

Phaser is no longer part of the Core Library as of 11.0 but can still be found in the User Library. Live Sets that were made in earlier versions, e.g. 10.1.30,  that contain Phaser will still open with that specific device in 11.0 and later.</p><p>Phaser uses a series of all-pass filters to create a phase shift in the frequency spectrum of a sound.</p><p>The Poles control creates notches in the frequency spectrum. The Feedback control can then be used to invert the waveform and convert these notches into peaks (or poles). Filter cutoff frequency is changed with the Frequency control, which can be adjusted in tandem with Feedback using the effect’s X-Y controller.</p><p>The device has two modes, Space and Earth, for changing the spacing of notches along the spectrum, and hence the ”color” of the sound. This effect can be further adjusted with the Color control.</p><p>Periodic control of the filter frequency is possible using the envelope section. You can increase or decrease the envelope amount (or invert its shape with negative values), and then use the Attack and Release controls to define envelope shape.</p><p>Phaser contains two LFOs to modulate filter frequency for the left and right stereo channels. The LFOs have six possible waveform shapes: sine, square, triangle, sawtooth up, sawtooth down and random. The extent of LFO influence on the filter frequency is set with the Amount control.</p><p>LFO speed is controlled with the Rate control, which can be set in terms of hertz. Rate can also be synced to the song tempo and set in meter subdivisions (e.g., sixteenth notes).</p><p>The Phase control lends the sound stereo movement by setting the LFOs to run at the same frequency, but offsetting their waveforms relative to each other. Set this to ”180”, and the LFOs will be perfectly out of phase (180 degrees apart), so that when one reaches its peak, the other is at its minimum.</p><p>Spin detunes the two LFO speeds relative to each other. Each filter frequency is then modulated using a different LFO frequency, as determined by the Spin amount.</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

All modes can be used to create lush, expressive sounds with a wide variety of tools and detailed options. Two LFOs and an envelope follower provide plenty of modulation possibilities.</p><p>You can choose between the three modes in the display:</p><ul><li>Phaser, with its wide range of frequency and modulation ranges, creates wandering notch filters by feeding a phase-shifted version of the input signal back into the input. The phase shifting is achieved using modulated all-pass filters and has a lush sound.</li><li>Flanger creates a continuously changing comb filter effect by adding a time-modulated delayed signal with feedback to the input.</li><li>Doubler creates the effect of doubled tracks (multiple stacked versions of similar recording takes) by adding time-modulated delayed signals to the input.</li></ul><p>The display contains a visualization and the mode selector buttons. The visualization presents different information depending on the mode you choose and the LFO Stereo Mode’s settings (described in more detail below).</p><p>In Phaser mode, the visualization shows the number of notches and their spectral positions.</p><p>Phaser’s parameters can be adjusted in the lower portion of the display.</p><p>Notches increases or decreases the number of all-pass filters being used. Center chooses the center frequency of the notches. Spread increases or decreases the distance between the notches by adjusting the Q factor of the all-pass filters. Blend mixes the modulation routing between Center Frequency and Spread, with Center Frequency at 0.0 and Spread at 1.0.</p><p>In Flanger mode, the visualization shows how the modulation signal is affecting the delay time, with the left-most position equaling the value chosen in the Time parameter. As the visualization moves to the right, the delay time decreases; as it moves to the left, it increases. Time adjusts the delay time of the Flanger delay lines.</p><p>In Doubler mode, the visualization acts differently than in Flanger mode. Modulation in Doubler mode is bipolar, meaning that, as the visualization moves to the right, the delay time increases; as it moves to the left, it decreases. Time adjusts the delay time of the Doubler delay lines.</p><p>For finer control over the sound, you can unfold the device by toggling the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_fold.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in Phaser-Flanger’s title bar to reveal further options for the main LFO, as well as a second LFO, an envelope follower and a Safe Bass high-pass filter.

Use the Modulation Sync buttons to the left of the dial to switch between Frequency and Sync Rate. When set to Hz, the corresponding Freq dial controls the LFO rate in Hertz; otherwise, the Rate dial will sync the LFO with the song tempo.</p><p>Multiple waveforms for the main LFO are available and can be found in the LFO Waveform chooser. These include Sine, Triangle (default), Saw Up, Saw Down, Rectangle, Random, and Random S&amp;H (Sample and Hold). Also included are Triangle Analog, Triangle 8, Triangle 16, which are described below:</p><ul><li>Triangle Analog is a low-pass filtered rectangular waveform which changes shape and amplitude drastically for different LFO rates.</li><li>Triangle 8 divides a period of a normal triangular wave into eight discrete steps.</li><li>Triangle 16 divides a period of a normal triangular wave into 16 discrete steps.</li></ul><p>The LFO Stereo Mode button switches between Phase and Spin modes, both of which allow modulation of each stereo channel independently.</p><p>When Phase is chosen, adjusting the Phase value will change the phase relationship between the left and right channels. At 180°, the phase of the left and right channels are completely inverted. This can be seen in the LFOs visualization.</p><p>When Spin is chosen, adjusting the Spin value detunes the two LFO rates relative to each other. This can be seen in the main display’s visualization.</p><p>Duty Cycle will change the time scale of the waveform’s period, compressing it towards either the front of the cycle (100%) or the back of the cycle (-100%). At 0%, the time scale of the period is spread equally across the entire cycle, leaving the waveform unaffected. This is similar to how Pulse Width affects rectangular waveforms, and its effects can be seen in the waveform view of the main LFO. This parameter doesn’t affect the noise-based Random and Random S&amp;H modulation waveforms.</p><p>The second LFO always has a triangular waveform, and can be controlled using the LFO2 Mix and LFO2 Freq/Rate parameters.</p><p>LFO2 Mix sets the amount of the LFO2 that is mixed with the main LFO. At 0%, only the main LFO is active; at 100% only LFO2 is active.</p><p>The second LFO’s speed can be set as either free-running or tempo-synced by using the Modulation Sync 2 toggle buttons. When free-running, the sync frequencies are shown in Hertz and can be adjusted using the LFO2 Freq parameter. When tempo-synced, beat divisions are shown instead and can be set using the LFO2 Rate parameter.</p><p>Global parameters available include Amount, Feedback, Output, Warmth and Dry/Wet. The additional envelope follower and Safe Bass high-pass filter are accessible when the device is unfolded.</p><p>Amount adjusts the amount of delay modulation that is applied to incoming signals and affects both the main LFO and LFO2.</p><p>Feedback sets the amount of each channel’s output that is fed back to its input. Increasing this sounds more extreme and tends to create a strong comb filtering effect, amplifying some frequencies and attenuating others. In Doubler Mode, it will also create audible delays if playback is stopped. The feedback signal can be inverted using the Ø button, which results in a “hollow” sound when combined with high feedback values.</p><p>Caution: high feedback values in combination with certain settings can cause quick increases in volume levels. Be sure to protect your ears and equipment!</p><p>Below the main LFO you will find an envelope follower. An envelope follower uses the amplitude from an incoming audio signal and translates it to a modulation source.</p><p>To use the envelope follower, activate the Env Fol button and set the Envelope Amount value to a value other than zero. Envelope Amount adjusts the intensity of the modulation caused by the envelope follower. Negative values invert the phase of the envelope.</p><p>Attack and Release adjust the attack and release portions of the envelope follower’s envelope. Shorter Attack times cause the envelope follower to act more quickly, while longer times delay its onset. Shorter Release times cause the envelope follower to stop its effect faster than longer Release times.</p><p>Safe Bass is a high-pass filter, effectively reducing the effect on signal components below the specified frequency. The applicable range is from 5 Hz to 3000 Hz. This can make mixing certain bass-heavy material easier.</p><p>Output sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal. The Warmth control adds slight distortion and filtering for a warmer sound. The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100% when using Phaser-Flanger in a return track.</p></section><section id="redux" data-number="1.33"><h2 data-number="25.33"><span class="header-section-number">25.33</span> Redux</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Redux.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=294"><figcaption>The Redux Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>The Redux effect has a variety of parameters for creating a wide range of jagged and edgy sounds. You can radically mangle any source material, with effects ranging from harsh distortion and digital aliasing artifacts to warm, fat 8-bit grit. Extra noise and stereo width can be added to the downsampling process, while filtering further transforms the sound. The quantizer’s amplitude curve can also be changed to allow both subtle and drastic bitcrushing.</p><p>Redux makes use of two different digital signal manipulation techniques: downsampling and bit reduction.</p><section id="downsampling" data-number="1.33.1"><h3 data-number="25.33.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.33.1</span> Downsampling</h3><p>The downsampling controls are available on the left side of the device. Using Redux’s downsampler without any filters engaged introduces inharmonic frequency content into the spectrum. The frequency range of the added content is dependent upon the relationship between the frequency content of the material and the sample rate chosen in the device.</p><p>Rate sets the sample rate to which the signal is degraded. Lower values result in increased imaging and more inharmonic tones.</p><p>Jitter adds noise to the downsampler’s clock signal, which introduces randomness to the downsampling process. This results in a noisier sound, as well as increased stereo width.</p><p>The Filter section has both a Pre and a Post setting. Enabling the Pre button engages a filter before downsampling, which reduces the bandwidth of the signal processed by downsampling. When Jitter is in use, it also reduces the stereo width of the signal.</p><p>The Post button engages a low-pass filter after the downsampling process, which reduces imaging. The Post filter frequency can be adjusted using the Post-Filter Octave slider.

Bit reduction decreases the number of bits used to represent the digital signal, reducing dynamic range while adding distortion and noise. At extreme settings, all original dynamics are lost and sounds are reduced to jagged square waves.</p><p>The Bits control reduces the number of bits being used. The value shown represents the number of bits used to encode the output signal. Reducing this value increases noise and distortion while reducing dynamic range.</p><p>Shape varies the shape of the quantizer’s characteristic curve. Higher values produce a finer resolution for smaller amplitudes, meaning that subtle signal components will be less affected than louder ones. The total amount of distortion produced with different Shape settings will depend upon the dynamic range of the input signal.</p><p>Enabling the DC Shift button applies an amplitude offset before the quantization process. This significantly changes the sound of the quantization distortion, especially when Bits is set to lower values, increasing volume and adding crunch!</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.

Redux Legacy returns us to the Dark Ages of digital by reducing a signal’s sample rate and bit resolution.</p><p>The Downsample section has two parameters: ”Downsample” and a downsample Mode switch.</p><p>If the downsample dial is set to ”1”, every input sample passes to the output and the signal does not change. If set to ”2”, only every second sample will be processed, so the result sounds a bit more ”digital.” The higher the number, the lower the resulting sample rate, and the more ”deconstructed” the sound. Downsampling is like applying a mosaic effect to an image: There’s a loss of information and sharp edges occur between the blocks.</p><p>The Downsample Mode switch defines if the downsampling either interpolates over a smaller range (”soft,” down to 20.0 samples) or does not interpolate over a larger range (”hard,” down to 200 samples).</p><p>Bit Reduction is similar, but while downsampling superimposes a grid in time, bit reduction does the same for amplitude.</p><p>If the Bit Reduction amplitude dial is set to 8, amplitude levels are quantized to 256 steps (8 bit resolution). If set to 1, the result is pretty brutal: Each sample contains either a full positive or full negative signal, with nothing in between.</p><p>Bit Reduction defines an input signal of 0dB as 16 bit. Signals above 0dB are clipped, and the red overload LED will light up.</p><p>Turning off Bit Reduction results in modest CPU savings.</p></section><section id="resonators" data-number="1.35"><h2 data-number="25.35"><span class="header-section-number">25.35</span> Resonators</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Resonators.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Resonators Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Resonators effect is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</p><p>This device consists of five parallel resonators that superimpose a tonal character on the input source. It can produce sounds resembling anything from plucked strings to vocoder-like effects. The resonators are tuned in semitones, providing a musical way of adjusting them. The first resonator defines the root pitch and the four others are tuned relative to this pitch in musical intervals.</p><p>The input signal passes first through a filter, and then into the resonators. There are four input filter types to select from: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass and notch. The input filter frequency can be adjusted with the Frequency parameter.</p><p>The first resonator is fed with both the left and right input channels, while the second and fourth resonators are dedicated to the left channel, and the third and fifth to the right channel.</p><p>The Note parameter defines the root pitch of all the resonators ranging from C-1 to C5. It can also be detuned in cents using the Fine parameter. The Decay parameter lets you adjust the amount of time it takes for the resonators to be silent after getting an input signal. The longer the decay time, the more tonal the result will be, similar to the behavior of an undamped piano string. As with a real string, the decay time depends on the pitch, so low notes will last longer than higher ones. The Const switch holds the decay time constant regardless of the actual pitch.</p><p>Resonators provides two different resonation modes. Mode A provides a more realistic sounding resonation, while Mode B offers an effect that is especially interesting when Resonator I’s Note parameter is set to lower pitches.</p><p>The brightness of the resulting sound can be adjusted using the Color control.</p><p>All of the resonators have an On/Off switch and a Gain control. A resonator that is turned off does not need CPU. Turning off the first resonator does not affect the other ones.</p><p>Resonators II through V follow the Note parameter defined in Resonator I, but they can each be individually transposed +/- 24 semitones using the Pitch controls and detuned in cents using the Detune controls.</p><p>The output section features the obligatory Dry/Wet control and a Width parameter that affects only the wet signal and blends the left and right outputs of Resonators II-V into a mono signal if set to zero.</p></section><section id="reverb" data-number="1.36"><h2 data-number="25.36"><span class="header-section-number">25.36</span> Reverb</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Reverb.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Reverb Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>Reverb is an audio effect that simulates the acoustic properties of audio as it echoes throughout a physical space.</p><p>In the real world, reverberation exists as a product of sound waves that reflect off of rigid surfaces in an environment and the subsequent tonal shaping of these waves by absorbent materials within their trajectory. In a digital context, however, this phenomenon is approximated with a combination of filters and modulated delay lines.</p><p>The Reverb device provides granular control of all of these factors in order to create unique spaces for audio to travel through that range from intimate recording rooms to massive canyons, and everything in between.</p><section id="input-filter" data-number="1.36.1"><h3 data-number="25.36.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.36.1</span> Input Filter</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ReverbInputFilter.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Reverb’s Input Filter Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The input signal passes first through low and high cut filters, whose X-Y controller allows changing the band’s center frequency (X-axis) and bandwidth (Y-axis).

Their amplitude and distribution give an impression of the room’s character.</p><p>Spin applies modulation to the early reflections. The Amount and Rate sliders control the amount and rate of these modulations respectively. A higher Amount setting tends to provide a less-colored (more spectrally neutral) late diffusion response. If the modulation rate is too high, doppler frequency shifting of the source sound will occur, along with surreal panning effects. Spin may be turned off, using the associated switch, for modest CPU savings.</p><p>The Shape control sculpts the prominence of the early reflections, as well as their overlap with the diffused sound. With small values, the reflections decay more gradually and the diffused sound occurs sooner, leading to a larger overlap between these components. With large values, the reflections decay more rapidly and the diffused onset occurs later. A higher value can sometimes improve the source’s intelligibility, while a lower value may give a smoother decay.</p></section><section id="diffusion-network" data-number="1.36.3"><h3 data-number="25.36.3"><span class="header-section-number">25.36.3</span> Diffusion Network</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ReverbDiffusionNetwork.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Reverb’s Diffusion Network Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The Diffusion Network creates the reverberant tail that follows the early reflections.</p><p>High and low shelving filters provide frequency-dependent reverberation decay.

This delays the reverberation relative to the input signal. One’s impression of the size of a real room depends partly on this delay. Typical values for natural sounds range from 1 ms to 25 ms.</p><p>The Smooth chooser specifies the behavior of the Size parameter when its value is adjusted. If set to None, the Diffusion Network’s delay times are changed immediately, which can cause artifacts when changing the Size value. If set to Slow or Fast, new delay times are updated over a specific time period, which results in a smoother sound when transitioning between values.</p><p>The Size parameter controls the room’s volume. At one extreme, a very large size will lend a shifting, diffused delay effect to the reverb. The other extreme — a very small value — will give it a highly colored, metallic feel.</p><p>The Decay control adjusts the time required for this reverb tail to drop to 1/1000th (-60 dB) of its initial amplitude.</p><p>The Freeze control freezes the diffuse response of the input sound. When on, the reverberation will sustain almost endlessly. Flat bypasses the high and low shelf filters when Freeze is on. If Flat is off, the frozen reverberation will lose energy in the attenuated frequency bands, depending on the state of the high and low shelving filters. Cut modifies Freeze by preventing the input signal from adding to the frozen reverberation; when off, the input signal will contribute to the diffused amplitude.</p><p>The Stereo control determines the width of the output’s stereo image. At the highest setting of 120 degrees, each ear receives a reverberant channel that is independent of the other (this is also a property of the diffusion in real rooms). The lowest setting mixes the output signal to mono.</p><p>The Density chooser controls the tradeoff between reverb quality and performance.

Its selection of non-linear shaper curves and filters can be combined to produce a wide variety of saturation types, from targeted warmth to sweeping harmonic motion or glitchy blasts of noise. Roar’s feedback controls and built-in compressor add a further layer of distinctive possibility to the device, which can produce sounds unlike any other instrument or effect currently available in Live.</p><section id="input-section-1" data-number="1.37.1"><h3 data-number="25.37.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.37.1</span> Input Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RoarInputSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Roar’s Input Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The Drive knob sets the level of the signal being input into Roar before the gain stages. It can be used to quickly add or remove distortion without having to adjust individual Shaper Amount controls across multiple gain stages, for example, or to modify an input signal to ensure a preset behaves as expected.</p><p>The Tone Amount knob changes the input signal’s balance of high and low frequencies. When set to positive values, high frequencies are boosted and low frequencies are attenuated. When set to negative values, low frequencies are boosted and high frequencies are attenuated.</p><p>The Tone Frequency slider sets the frequency of the low shelving filter used by the Tone Amount control.</p><p>Adjusting Roar’s Tone parameters has noticeable effects on the timbre of its gain stages, as these follow the Input section in Roar’s processing chain. Dialing in positive values with the Tone Amount knob can help attenuate low-frequency content in guitars or basses, for example, to avoid muddy sounds when using large amounts of distortion.</p><p>The Color Compensation toggle next to the Tone Amount control applies a mirrored version of the Tone filter to the output of Roar’s distortion stages. When active, Tone values are attenuated before the shaper and boosted after it, giving you more control over the gain staging process. Activating the Color Compensation toggle with negative Tone values is a helpful trick for saturating drums without affecting low end frequency impact, for example.</p><p>The Routing Mode panel lets you choose from six routing types: Single, Serial, Parallel, Multi Band, Mid Side, and Feedback. Apart from Single and Multi Band modes, each routing mode has a Blend control that allows you to control the blend between its two gain stages.</p><p>Serial mode processes the input signal using two concatenated shapers. The Blend control blends between the sound of Stage 1 and the sound of Stages 1 and 2 combined.</p><p>Parallel mode processes the input signal using two independent shapers. The Blend control blends between the sound of Stage 1 and the sound of Stage 2. To experiment with this mode, try selecting two noticeably different Shaper Curves (like Rectified and Fractal) and modulating the Blend control so that Meld’s sound shifts continuously from one to the other.</p><p>Multi Band mode splits the frequency spectrum into three bands (Low, Mid and High) that can each be processed independently. Two Crossover Filters (Low and High) let you define the crossover frequency between the three bands. This mode serves a variety of applications, including drum processing and adding saturation to entire mixes.</p><p>Mid Side mode processes the input signal’s mono and stereo signals independently. This mode is useful for enhancing a signal’s stereo image without compromising the sound of the signal at the center of the stereo field.</p><p>Feedback mode processes the input signal and its feedback independently, which can create unusual tones or transform Roar into a distinctive delay. Try modulating Roar’s Shaper Amount with an envelope to produce saturation that has a shuffled delay effect, for example, or subtly offsetting Shaper Bias to create delays that degrade over time.</p></section><section id="gain-stage-section" data-number="1.37.2"><h3 data-number="25.37.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.37.2</span> Gain Stage Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RoarGainStageSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Roar’s Gain Stage Section.</figcaption></figure><p>Each routing mode has its own set of gain stages, which can be turned on or off independently using the Stage toggles in the Gain Stage tabs.</p><p>Gain Stage tabs all have the same three controls: Shaper Amount, Shaper Bias, and Filter Frequency. Shaper and Filter Types can be selected from their corresponding drop-down menus at the bottom of each Gain Stage tab.</p><p>The Shaper Amount control sets the amount of saturation applied to the input signal. You can also click and drag the shaper waveform in the Shaper Visualization display to modify this parameter. Distortion occurs when the input signal reaches non-linear portions of the visualized curve.</p><p>The Shaper Bias control offsets the signal and creates asymmetrical distortion. At higher settings, it can emulate the sound of a broken circuit. At more extreme settings, it will cause the signal to go completely quiet.</p><p>The Shaper Type drop-down menu under the Shaper Visualization display has twelve curves to choose from:</p><p><em>Soft Sine</em> uses a sinusoidal curve to add smooth, warm saturation to the input signal. This shaper curve tends to produce pleasant, analog-style distortion even when pushed to extreme levels.</p><p><em>Digital Clip</em> applies a hard clipping curve to the input signal. It produces harsh, higher-order harmonics when the input signal reaches the curve’s extremities.</p><p><em>Bit Crusher</em> produces the characteristic distortion that occurs when quantized amplitudes are applied to an input signal, similar to Live’s Redux device. Increasing the Shaper Amount reduces the number of bits used for quantization and intensifies the effects of the bit crusher’s built-in compander. This curve works well with bias modulation and produces very obvious changes in quieter signals.</p><p><em>Diode Clipper</em> this type is a virtual analog clipping circuit emulation. It sounds smooth and warm like the Soft Sine curve, but with attenuated high-end frequencies.</p><p><em>Tube Preamp</em> models the soft, analog saturation of a tube preamp. It preserves a signal’s transients and dynamics even when the Shaper Amount is set to higher levels.</p><p><em>Half Wave Rectifier and Full Wave Rectifier</em> produce distinctive, waveshaper-style effects. Half Wave Rectifier applies completely asymmetrical distortion to the input signal, which works well for adding crunch to drum sounds. Full Wave Rectifier shifts the signal up by an octave, which works well for adding harmonic depth to certain synth sounds.</p><p><em>Polynomial</em> shifts between a sinusoidal curve and more complex waveforms. This shaper curve lends itself well to modulation and to producing metallic sounds.</p><p><em>Fractal</em> introduces a large of amount of high-end harmonics to the input signal.</p><p><em>Tri Fold</em> this type is a triangular wavefolder. Like Fractal, it adds a large amount of high-end harmonics to the input but achieves even harsher, more distorted results.</p><p><em>Noise Injection</em> applies stereo noise followed by smooth distortion to the input signal. This curve works well for producing smooth saturation that also has some dirt and grit.</p><p><em>Shards</em> continuously changes the slope of its stereo curve segments to rhythmically break apart the input signal.</p><p>Shapers can also be turned on or off via the toggle at the bottom of the Shaper Visualization display.</p><p>The Shaper Level control can be used to compensate for changes in output level produced as the shaper curve is modified.</p><p>Filter Frequency adjusts the filter’s cutoff frequency. If the Pre toggle has been activated, the filter is applied before the Shaper stage. When the Filter Frequency is changed with Pre activated, the filter doesn’t affect the harmonics produced by the shaper.</p><p>There are eight filter types to choose from: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, notch, peak, morph, comb, and resampling. The Comb filter creates a series of notches across the frequency spectrum. When its cutoff is modulated, this filter type can produce flanger-like effects. The Resampling filter produces sample-rate reduction artifacts, similar to Live’s Redux device.</p><p>Apart from the Resampling filter, each filter has a dedicated Resonance control. The Peak filter has a Filter Peak Gain control for boosting or attenuating a specific frequency range. The Morph filter has a Morph control for setting its filter shape.</p></section><section id="modulation-section" data-number="1.37.3"><h3 data-number="25.37.3"><span class="header-section-number">25.37.3</span> Modulation Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RoarModulationSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Roar’s Modulation Section.</figcaption></figure><p>To display Roar’s modulation parameters, click on the toggle in the Modulation panel.

Rate speed can be set in Hertz or tempo-synced and can be modified by clicking and dragging a given rate up or down. Morph and Smooth controls can be changed in real time or modulated to further sculpt LFO shapes.</p><p>The Env tab’s envelope follower generates a modulation signal based on Roar’s input signal. Attack, Release, Threshold, Gain, Frequency, and Width controls let you hone in on the element you’d like to isolate, even in busy sound sources. When activated, the Envelope Input Listen toggle plays back the input signal only. Note that the Envelope Follower’s filter only affects what the envelope reacts to, not Roar’s output signal.</p><p>The Envelope Follower is particularly useful as a modulation source in Roar’s Modulation Matrix. Try setting it to follow a snare sound in a drum loop, for example, and have it modulate Roar’s Dry/Wet balance or its Shaper Amount each time the snare hits.</p><p>The Noise modulation source includes four different noise types: Simplex, Wander, S &amp; H, and Brown. Noise curves can be set in Hertz or tempo-synced and can be smoothed like Roar’s LFO curves.</p><p>Simplex and Wander both generate smoothed random signals, with different random value interpolation algorithms used to produce different signal dynamics. Simplex uses interrate modulation, which produces a more irregular value interval than Wander. These types of noise are useful for introducing small, random, organic-style changes in Roar’s output signal, especially when set to low rates.</p><p>S &amp; H (Sample and Hold) generates a random constant value that changes to a new random value at an interval determined by the Noise Rate. This is useful for creating stepped random modulation patterns in Roar’s output signal.</p><p>Brown produces low-pass filtered white noise, which is useful for producing a constant noise floor or for adding crackles and hissing to Roar’s output signal.</p><p>The Matrix tab lets you assign modulation sources to modulation targets within the device. Clicking a parameter while the Matrix tab is open will set it as a modulation target. Modulation sources are listed horizontally and modulation targets are listed vertically. Click and drag a cell up or down to apply modulation between parameters.</p><p>The Global Modulation Amount slider can be dragged up or down to increase or decrease the modulation being applied globally. Clicking the X button will erase all modulation applied by the Modulation Matrix.</p><p>The Modulation Matrix can also be expanded using the toggle in the device header.

Feeding Roar’s signal back into itself can add a new layer of ringing, otherworldly tones and textures to your sound.</p><p>The Feedback Mode drop-down lets you choose between five feedback modes: Time, Synced, Triplet, Dotted, and Note. Synced and Time modes let you use Roar’s Feedback as a delay. Note mode lets you set the feedback’s ring to a specific pitch.</p><p>The Feedback Amount knob sets the amount of signal being fed back into Roar’s input. Because a compressor is present in Roar’s feedback loop, loud signals will temporarily attenuate the amount of feedback being generated as gain reduction is applied by the compressor.</p><p>When the Feedback Invert toggle is turned on, the phase of Roar’s feedback signal is inverted.

It can coat input signals with a soft saturation or drive them into many different flavors of distortion.</p><p>An X-Y grid helps to visualize Saturator’s shaping curve. The shaper’s input and output values are mapped to the X and Y axes, respectively. The curve defines the transfer function, which is the extent to which output values fluctuate in relation to input values. Because this is usually a nonlinear process, the incoming signal is reshaped to a greater or lesser degree depending upon its level at each moment in time.</p><p>Incoming signals are first clipped to the dB level set by the Drive control. The meter on the right side of the display shows how much Saturator is influencing the signal.</p><p>Signal shaping has six fixed modes: Analog Clip, Soft Sine, Medium Curve, Hard Curve, Sinoid Fold and Digital Clip. There is also the flexible Waveshaper mode, featuring six adjustable waveshaping parameters.</p><p>In the Analog Clip and Digital Clip modes, the signal is clipped completely and immediately. Soft Sine, Medium Curve and Hard Curve modes soften signal clipping to varying degrees. Sinoid Fold mode can be good for special effects.</p><p>The most dramatic effects can be created by selecting the Waveshaper curve, which has its own dedicated set of controls. To access these six parameter fields, unfold the Saturator window by toggling the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_fold.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in its title bar.</p><p>The Waveshaper mode’s six additional parameters are: Drive, Lin, Curve, Damp, Depth and Period.</p><ul><li><em>Drive</em> determines how much the input signal will be influenced by the Waveshaper parameters. Setting Drive to zero will negate the effect entirely.</li><li><em>Lin</em> works together with the Curve and Depth parameters to alter the linear portion of the shaping curve.</li><li><em>Curve</em> adds mostly third-order harmonics to the input signal.</li><li><em>Damp</em> flattens any signal near the grid’s origin. It behaves like an ultra-fast noise gate.</li><li><em>Depth</em> controls the amplitude of a sine wave that is superimposed onto the distortion curve.</li><li><em>Period</em> determines the density of ripples in the superimposed sine wave.</li></ul><p>The DC button activates a DC filter at Saturator’s input stage. This is mainly useful for removing DC offsets from audio material that contains them.</p><p>Activating the Color button enables two filters. The first of these, controlled with the Base control, dictates how much the effect will be reduced or increased for very low frequencies. The second filter, essentially an equalizer, is used for controlling higher frequencies. It is shaped with the Freq (cutoff frequency), Width and Depth controls.</p><p>The Output control attenuates the level at the device output. When the Soft Clip switch is activated, Saturator will also apply an instance of its ”Analog Clip” curve to the output.</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals. Set it to 100 percent when using Saturator in a return track.</p><p>Aliasing can be reduced by enabling Hi-Quality mode, which can be accessed via the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu. This improves the sound quality, particularly with high frequency signals, but there is a slight increase in CPU usage.</p></section><section id="shifter" data-number="1.39"><h2 data-number="25.39"><span class="header-section-number">25.39</span> Shifter</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Shifter.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Shifter Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: The Shifter effect is not available in the Lite or Intro Editions.)</p><p>Shifter is a multi-purpose pitch and frequency-shifting audio effect that can be used to add ring modulation to incoming audio or to shift the pitch or frequency of audio in real time.</p><section id="tuning-and-delay-section" data-number="1.39.1"><h3 data-number="25.39.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.39.1</span> Tuning and Delay Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ShifterTuningSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Shifter’s Tuning and Delay Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The Coarse and Fine knobs adjust the pitch or frequency in the given value, depending on which shift mode (explained in the Shifter Mode section (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#shifter-mode-section">‘Shifter Mode Section’</a>)) is selected.</p><p>Enabling the Wide button inverts the polarity of the Spread value for the right channel, creating a stereo effect.

You can highlight chosen frequencies of the resonating partials and alter their decay, creating either short percussive reverberations or long washed-out tones. Choose which frequencies are affected through an internal resonator or via an external MIDI sidechain. Similar to a vocoder, you can use the MIDI input to place the resonances in key with its surrounding musical elements, playing the effect polyphonically with up to 16 voices. Spectral Resonator also offers several spectral processing types on the input signal, including spectral filtering, spectral chorus, and granularization.</p><p>Spectral Resonator uses a spectrogram to display how frequencies in the dry and wet signals behave over time. Dry signals are represented in yellow, while wet signals are shown in blue. You can hide the visualization by clicking on its toggle button.</p><p>On the left side of the device, you will find the Pitch Mode section. Different controls are available depending on whether Internal mode or MIDI mode is selected.</p><p>When Internal mode is enabled, Spectral Resonator will be tuned to the frequency set by the Freq dial. The frequency can be set either in Hertz or to a specific pitch; to toggle between the two options, use the Frequency Dial Mode buttons. Note that the MIDI mode controls are disabled in Internal mode.</p><p>When MIDI mode is enabled, Spectral Resonator can be tuned to the frequencies of incoming MIDI notes. When MIDI mode is enabled, the MIDI router, Mono/Poly switch, Polyphony control, MIDI Gate, Glide and Pitch Bend range controls are also enabled.</p><p>The MIDI router allows you to choose any MIDI track as a source. To use an external MIDI controller, use the “MIDI From” chooser on any MIDI track to select your MIDI controller. Then, in Spectral Resonator, choose the track with the selected MIDI controller in the “MIDI From” drop-down chooser.</p><p>The MIDI input can be transposed using the Transpose dial (displayed as “Transp. “) with a range of +/- 48 semitones.</p><p>The Mono/Poly switch enables polyphony for incoming MIDI, enabling you to send polyphonic material such as chords to Spectral Resonator. You can choose between 2, 4, 8, or 16 voices in the Polyphony chooser. The number of harmonics set by the Harmonics control are evenly distributed between the voices, resulting in fewer harmonics per voice when high voice counts are used. The combination of high Polyphony and Unison values will create a darker sound.</p><p>When the MIDI Gate button is deactivated, audio input will still excite the resonator, even when no MIDI notes are playing. When activated, the device behaves more like an instrument, and will only resonate while MIDI notes are being played. In Polyphonic mode, MIDI Gate is always active, so you will need to play MIDI notes to produce sound.</p><p>The Glide parameter adjusts the time in milliseconds over which it takes notes to slide their pitch to the next incoming pitch. Note that this is only active in Mono mode. The PB parameter defines the effect of MIDI pitch bend messages, allowing a range of 0-24 semitones. Note that Spectral Resonator is also able to receive MPE.</p><p>The Harmonics parameter (in the upper right corner of the spectrogram) changes the number of harmonics. More harmonics will lead to a brighter sound and fewer to a darker sound. Note also that a higher number of harmonics increases the CPU usage.</p><p>Stretch increases or decreases the spacing between the harmonics. Values below 0 will compress the distance, while values above 0 will stretch it. At 100%, only odd harmonics are created, which leads to a square-wave type sound.</p><p>Shift transposes the input signal’s spectrum up or down within a range of +/- 48 semitones. Note that this does not shift the spectrum of the actual effect, but rather the spectrum of the signal which is fed to the effect.</p><p>Decay adjusts the decay time in milliseconds. A higher value leads to sustained tones. HF Damp sets the amount of damping applied to high frequency partials. LF Damp sets the amount of damping applied to low frequency partials.</p><p>For both HF Damp and LF Damp, the frequencies affected by the control shift with the pitch of the Freq knob (when in Internal mode), or with any incoming MIDI notes (when in MIDI mode).</p><p>Using the available switches, you can choose between four Modulations Modes: None, Chorus, Wander, and Granular. These modes determine how each individual harmonic’s pitch and amplitude are modulated:</p><ul><li>None applies no modulation.</li><li>Chorus applies triangle wave modulation for every partial. When Mod Rate is set to 0, this mode only modulates the amplitudes of the partials.</li><li>Wander uses random sawtooth waveforms as the modulation source for each partial.</li><li>Granular modulates the amplitude of all partials randomly, using exponential decay envelopes. The partials are generated at random and, in this mode, the Mod Rate parameter affects the density of the partials.</li></ul><p>Both Wander and Granular modes will affect each individual Unison voice, creating very warbly, dense and indistinct sounds.</p><p>All Modulation Modes are also affected by the Mod Rate and Pch. Mod (pitch modulation) parameters. Mod Rate sets the modulation rate, while Pch. Mod adjusts the range of pitch modulation in semitones. Though Pch. Mod displays only a positive value, pitch modulation is applied in both a positive and negative direction (except in Granular mode, where the grain envelopes are only applied in a positive direction).</p><p>The Input Send dial sets the amount of gain applied to the processed signal. There is also a built-in limiter, to ensure that no signal gets too loud. The LED next to the Input Send dial will light up if the limiter is in use.</p><p>The Unison parameter allows you to choose 1, 2, 4, or 8 voices, while Unison Amount (displayed as “Uni. Amt”) adjusts the intensity of the unison effect. A higher Unison value increases the number of voices, and increasing the Unison Amount causes the voices to become further detuned from each other.</p><p>The Dry/Wet adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals and modifies the visibility of the two signals in the spectrogram. Set Dry/Wet to 100% when using Spectral Resonator in a return track.</p><section id="spectral-resonator-tips" data-number="1.40.1"><h3 data-number="25.40.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.40.1</span> Spectral Resonator Tips</h3><p>Here are some tips for using Spectral Resonator:</p><ul><li>Create tonal drum loops by placing Spectral Resonator on a drum track and using the MIDI sidechain input to feed specific pitches to Spectral Resonator. This can be used to add rhythm to your track with the same pitches as your bass, for example.</li><li>In order to have Spectral Resonator follow the pitches of melodic material, first use the Convert Harmony to New MIDI Track command (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/converting-audio-to-midi/#convert-harmony-to-new-midi-track">‘Convert Harmony to New MIDI Track’</a>) or the Convert Melody to New MIDI Track function (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/converting-audio-to-midi/#convert-melody-to-new-midi-track">‘Convert Melody to New MIDI Track’</a>), then send the generated MIDI track to Spectral Resonator.</li><li>Create reverb-type sounds by setting Frequency to a low value, setting Unison and Unison Amount to a high value, and use the Wander modulation mode in combination with low Mod Rate and Pch. Mod values. Adjust the Decay parameter to make the “reverb” decay longer or shorter.</li><li>Vocal processing - Spectral Resonator can be used like a vocoder by simply using your voice as the audio to be processed in combination with the MIDI sidechain input.</li><li>Use two Spectral Resonators in series to create overlapping harmonics by sending different MIDI signals to each of the Spectral Resonators.</li></ul></section></section><section id="spectral-time" data-number="1.41"><h2 data-number="25.41"><span class="header-section-number">25.41</span> Spectral Time</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SpectralTime.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Spectral Time Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Spectral Time effect is not available in the Intro, Lite and Standard Editions.)</p><p>Spectral Time combines time freezing and spectral delay effects in a single inspiring device.

With Max enabled, you can reset the maximum amplitude by clicking in the display.</p><p>The Scale X buttons allow you to toggle the scaling of the frequency display between linear, logarithmic, and semitone. Note that logarithmic and semitone are actually the same scaling, but switch the legending at the top of the display between Hertz and note names. Linear scaling is particularly useful for detailed analysis of high frequencies.</p><p>As you move your mouse over Spectrum’s display, a box appears that shows the amplitude, frequency and note name at the pointer’s position. The Range/Auto button at the bottom left of Spectrum’s interface toggles between manually and automatically adjusting the display’s dynamic range. With Range selected, you can zoom and scroll the amplitude by moving your mouse over the amplitude legending on the display’s left side. Drag vertically to scroll and horizontally to zoom. You can also use the Range sliders to set the minimum and maximum amplitude values shown. With Auto selected, the display automatically scales itself based on the incoming audio level. Note that in Auto mode, the Range sliders and zooming are disabled.</p><p>To get an even better view, you can toggle the location of the display between the device chain and Live’s main window by clicking the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_unfold.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in Spectrum’s title bar or by double-clicking in the display.</p></section><section id="tuner" data-number="1.43"><h2 data-number="25.43"><span class="header-section-number">25.43</span> Tuner</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Tuner.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Tuner Device.</figcaption></figure><p>Tuner analyzes and displays the incoming monophonic pitch as well as its distance from the nearest semitone.

As their names imply, they invert the phase of each channel.</p><p>The Channel Mode chooser allows selective processing of the left and right channels of a sample. If, for example, Left is selected, the right channel is ignored and the left channel appears on both outputs. This is especially useful if you have a stereo file that contains different information on both channels and you want to use only one.</p><p>The Width control sets the stereo width of the wet signal. 0% yields a mono signal whereas values above 100% create a widened stereo panorama.</p><p>Choosing Mid/Side Mode from the Width control <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu allows you to you toggle between the Width and Mid/Side controls. The Mid/Side control acts as a continuous mono to stereo controller when set from 0 to 100M. Setting the parameter to 100M will sum the audio to mono. Values between 0 and 100S emphasize the stereo or “out of phase” components of a signal. At 100S, only the side signal will be heard. The left and right channels will be 180 degrees out of phase with each other.</p><p>Note that if either Left or Right have been chosen in the Channel Mode chooser, the Width and Mid/Side controls have no function, and are therefore disabled.</p><p>When the Mono switch is enabled, the stereo input signal is converted to mono.</p><p>The Bass Mono switch converts the low frequencies of the input signal to mono. This is useful for avoiding coloration of low frequencies when they are replayed in mono. You can use the Bass Mono Frequency slider to adjust the cutoff frequency between 50-500 Hz.</p><p>When Bass Mono Audition is enabled, only the low frequencies can be heard. This can be useful for tuning the Bass Mono Frequency.</p><p>The Gain control adjusts the level of the input signal from -infinite dB to +35 dB. This can be particularly useful for automating volume fades on a track, while freeing up that track’s Volume control for mix balancing. (Note: when adjusting the Gain parameter between -18 and +35 dB using the up and down arrow keys, the value increases or decreases in 1 dB increments. However, between -18 dB and -inf dB, the value smoothly accelerates.)</p><p>The Balance control pans the signal anywhere in the stereo field.</p><p>The Mute button simply silences the incoming signal when enabled. Note: The active/mute controls of a track are always placed at the very end of the signal chain. However, since you can place Utility anywhere in a signal chain, you can use its mute function to cut the input of a delay line or reverb without turning off the output of these devices.</p><p>The DC switch filters out DC offsets and extremely low frequencies that are far below the audible range. It will only have a sonic effect if a signal contains these frequencies and is processed after Utility with nonlinear effects such as compressors or waveshapers.</p></section><section id="vinyl-distortion" data-number="1.45"><h2 data-number="25.45"><span class="header-section-number">25.45</span> Vinyl Distortion</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/VinylDistortion.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Vinyl Distortion Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Vinyl Distortion effect is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</p><p>The Vinyl Distortion effect emulates some of the typical distortions that occur on vinyl records during playback. These distortions are caused by the geometric relationships between the needle and the recorded groove. The effect also features a crackle generator for adding noisy artifacts.</p><p>The Tracing Model section adds even harmonic distortion to the input signal. Adjust the amount of distortion with the Drive knob, or click and drag vertically in the Tracing Model X-Y display. To adjust the distortion’s frequency or ”color,” drag horizontally in the X-Y display or double-click on the Freq field and type in a value. Holding the <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) modifier while dragging vertically in the X-Y display changes the frequency band’s Q (bandwidth).</p><p>The Pinch Effect section adds odd harmonics to the input signal. These distortions typically occur 180 degrees out of phase, creating a richer stereo image. The Pinch Effect has the same controls as the Tracing Model, but generates a rather different sound.</p><p>The Drive control increases or decreases the overall distortion amount created by both the Tracing Model and Pinch.</p><p>There are two distortion modes: Soft and Hard. The Soft Mode simulates the sound of a dub plate, while Hard Mode is more like that of a standard vinyl record.</p><p>The stereo/mono switch determines whether the Pinch distortion occurs in stereo or mono. Set it to stereo for realistic simulation of vinyl distortions.</p><p>The Crackle section adds noise to the signal, with noise density set by the Density control. The Volume control adjusts the amount of gain applied to the noise.</p></section><section id="vocoder" data-number="1.46"><h2 data-number="25.46"><span class="header-section-number">25.46</span> Vocoder</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Vocoder.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Vocoder Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Vocoder effect is not available in the Intro and Lite Editions.)</p><p>A vocoder is an effect that combines the frequency information of one audio signal (called the <em>carrier</em>) with the amplitude contour of another audio signal (called the <em>modulator</em>). The modulator source is generally something with a clear rhythmic character such as speech or drums, while the carrier is typically a harmonically-rich synthesizer sound such as a string or pad. The most familiar application of a vocoder is to create ”talking synthesizer” or robotic voice effects.</p><p>Vocoders work by running both the carrier and modulator signals through banks of band-pass filters. The output level of each of the modulator’s filters is then analyzed and used to control the volume of the corresponding filter for the carrier signal.</p><p>Live’s Vocoder should be inserted on the track that contains the audio material you plan to use as your modulator. The Carrier chooser then provides a variety of options for the carrier signal:</p><ul><li><em>Noise</em> uses Vocoder’s internal noise generator as the carrier source. With this selected, an X-Y display is shown which allows you to adjust the character of the noise. The horizontal axis adjusts downsampling. Click and drag to the left to decrease the sample rate of the carrier’s output. The vertical axis adjusts the density of the noise. Click and drag downward to decrease the density.</li><li><em>External</em> allows you to select any available internal routing points from the choosers below. This is the option you’ll want for classic ”robot voice” applications.</li><li><em>Modulator</em> uses the modulator itself as the carrier. This essentially outputs a resynthesized version of the modulator signal, but allows you to use Vocoder’s sound-shaping controls to adjust the sound.</li><li><em>Pitch Tracking</em> enables a monophonic oscillator, which tunes itself to the pitch of the modulator. The High and Low sliders allow you to limit the frequency range that the oscillator will attempt to track. Choose from sawtooth or one of three pulse waveforms and adjust the coarse tuning of the oscillator via the Pitch slider. Pitch tracking is particularly effective with monophonic modulator sources such as melodic instruments or voices. Note that the oscillator only updates its frequency when it detects a clear pitch. It then maintains this pitch until it detects a new one. This means that changing the oscillator’s parameters or causing it to reset (when grouping (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#group-tracks">‘Group Tracks’</a>) Vocoder’s track, for example) can cause unexpected changes in the sound. With polyphonic material or drums, pitch tracking is generally unpredictable (but can be very interesting.)</li></ul><p>Particularly when using external carrier sources, a vocoder’s output can sometimes lose a lot of high end. Enabling the Enhance button results in a brighter sound by normalizing the spectrum and dynamics of the carrier.</p><p>The Unvoiced knob adjusts the volume of an additional noise generator, which is used to resynthesize portions of the modulator signal that are pitchless, such as ”f” and ”s” sounds.</p><p>Sens. sets the sensitivity of the unvoiced detection algorithm. At 100%, the unvoiced noise generator is always on. At 0%, only the main carrier source is used. The Fast/Slow switch adjusts how quickly Vocoder switches between unvoiced and voiced detection.</p><p>Vocoder’s large central area shows the levels of the individual band-pass filters. Clicking within this display allows you to attenuate these levels.</p><p>The Bands chooser sets the number of filters that will be used. Using more bands results in a more accurate analysis of the modulator’s frequency content, but requires more CPU.</p><p>The Range sliders adjust the frequency range over which the band-pass filters will operate. For most sources, a fairly large range works well, but you may want to adjust the outer limits if the sound becomes too piercing or bassy. The BW control sets the bandwidth of the filters. At low percentages, each filter approaches a single frequency. As you increase the bandwidth, you increase the overlap of the filter bands. A bandwidth of 100% is the most accurate, but higher or lower settings can create interesting effects.</p><p>The Precise/Retro switch toggles between two types of filter behavior. In Precise mode, all filters have the same gain and bandwidth. In Retro mode, bands become narrower and louder at higher frequencies.</p><p>Gate sets a threshold for the filterbank. Any bands whose levels are below the threshold will be silent.</p><p>The Level slider boosts or cuts Vocoder’s output.</p><p>Depth sets how much of the modulator’s amplitude envelope is applied to the carrier’s signal. At 0%, the modulator’s envelope is discarded. At 200%, only high amplitude peaks will be used. 100% results in ”classic” vocoding.</p><p>The Attack and Release controls set how quickly Vocoder responds to amplitude changes in the modulator signal. Very fast times preserve the transients of the modulator, but can cause distortion artifacts.</p><p>The Mono/Stereo switches determine how many channels are used for the carrier and modulator. In Mono mode, both the carrier and modulator are treated as mono sources. Stereo uses a mono modulator but processes the carrier in stereo. L/R processes both the carrier and modulator signals in stereo.</p><p>The frequencies of the carrier’s filterbank can be shifted up or down via the Formant knob. With voice as the modulator, small Formant changes can alter the apparent gender of the source.</p><p>The Dry/Wet control adjusts the balance between the processed and dry signals.</p><section id="vocoder-tips" data-number="1.46.1"><h3 data-number="25.46.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.46.1</span> Vocoder Tips</h3><p>This section explains how to set up the most common Vocoder applications.</p><section id="singing-synthesizer" data-number="1.46.1.1"><h4 data-number="25.46.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">25.46.1.1</span> Singing Synthesizer</h4><p>The classic vocoder application is the ”singing synthesizer.” To set this up in Live:</p><ol type="1"><li>Insert Vocoder in the track that contains your vocal material. You can either use a clip that contains a prerecorded voice clip or, to process a live vocal signal, connect a microphone to a channel on your audio hardware and choose this as the input source (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#external-audio-in-out">‘External Audio In/Out’</a>) for the track.</li><li>Insert a synthesizer such as Analog (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#analog">‘Analog’</a>) in another track. Again, you can either create a MIDI clip to drive this synthesizer or play it live.</li><li>Set the vocoder’s Carrier chooser to External.</li><li>Select the synthesizer track in the vocoder’s Audio From choosers. (For best results, choose Post FX in the bottom chooser.)</li><li>If you’re creating your synthesizer and vocal material in real time, make sure the Arm button is enabled on both tracks.</li><li>Play the synthesizer as you speak into the microphone. You’ll hear the rhythm of your speech, but with the timbral character and frequencies of the synthesizer. To hear the vocoded signal alone, solo the voice track so that the ”normal” synthesizer track is muted.</li></ol><p>Note: you’ll generally get the best results if your synthesizer sound is bright and rich in harmonics. Try sawtooth-based patches to improve the intelligibility of the voice. For even more brightness and clarity, try adjusting the Unvoiced control and/or enabling Enhance.</p></section><section id="formant-shifter" data-number="1.46.1.2"><h4 data-number="25.46.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">25.46.1.2</span> Formant Shifter</h4><p>If the Vocoder is set to use the modulator as its own carrier, it can be used as a powerful formant shifter.

The sequence and speed of the pattern can be controlled by the device, which also provides a full complement of both classic and original arpeggiator features.</p><p>Arpeggiators are a classic element in Eighties synth music. The name originates with the musical concept of the “arpeggio,“ in which the notes comprising a chord are played as a series rather than in unison. “Arpeggio“ is derived from the Italian word “arpeggiare,“ which refers to playing notes on a harp.</p><section id="style-and-rate-sections" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="26.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">26.1.1</span> Style and Rate Sections</h3><p>Arpeggiator’s Style chooser determines the sequence of notes in the rhythmical pattern.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArpeggiatorUpWithDown.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>“Up“ and “Down“.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArpeggiatorUpDownDownUp.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>“UpDown“ and “DownUp“.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArpeggiatorDownUpUpDown.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>“Down &amp; Up“ and “Up &amp; Down“.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArpeggiatorConvergeDiverge.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>“Converge“ and “Diverge“.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArpeggiatorConvergeAndDiverge.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>“Con &amp; Diverge“.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArpeggiatorPinkyUpPinkyUpDown.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>“Pinky Up“ and “Pinky UpDown“.</figcaption></figure><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ArpeggiatorThumbUpThumbUpDown.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>“Thumb Up“ and “Thumb UpDown“.</figcaption></figure><p>Play Order places notes in the pattern according to the order in which they are played. This is therefore only recognizable when more than one chord or note has been played.</p><p>In addition to the Arpeggiator styles above, there is a Chord Trigger mode which repeats the incoming notes as a block chord, as well as three settings for creating random arpeggios:</p><ul><li>Choosing <em>Random</em> will produce a continuously randomized sequence of the incoming MIDI notes.</li><li><em>Random Other</em> creates random patterns from incoming MIDI notes, but will not repeat a given note until all other incoming notes have been used.</li><li><em>Random Once</em> creates one random pattern from incoming MIDI notes and repeats that pattern until the incoming MIDI changes, at which point a new pattern is created.</li></ul><p>Arpeggiator will play the pattern of notes at the speed set by the Rate control, which can be calibrated in either milliseconds or beat-time using the neighboring Sync/Free button. With Sync chosen, Arpeggiator will be synced to the song tempo.</p><p>A Gate control to the right of Rate determines the length of notes played by Arpeggiator as a percentage of the current Rate setting. Any setting larger than 100% will therefore play notes that overlap (i.e., are legato).</p><p>The rhythmic pattern generated by Arpeggiator does not necessarily have to be straight; a selection of groove patterns can be applied with the respective control just beneath the Mode chooser. Grooves in Arpeggiator behave similarly to grooves in clips, and the intensity of the groove is determined by the Amount slider in the Groove Pool (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-grooves/#groove-pool">‘Groove Pool’</a>).</p><p>With the Hold parameter active, Arpeggiator will continue to play the pattern even after the keyboard keys have been released. The pattern will be repeated until any other key is pressed. When Hold is active and any of the original keys also remain physically held, notes can be added to the pattern simply by playing them. Notes can also be removed from the pattern in this scenario by playing them a second time, allowing the gradual buildup and rearrangement of the pattern over time.</p><p><em>Tip</em>: If you want the pattern to stop playing, momentarily deactivate Hold.</p><p>The Offset parameter shifts the sequence of notes in the pattern by the number of places selected with the control. This is best illustrated with an example: A setting of “1“ makes the second note in the pattern play first, and the first note last. If you imagine the pattern as a circle of notes that is played in a clockwise direction from a set start point, the Offset parameter effectively rotates this circle counter-clockwise one note at a time, changing where in the pattern play begins.</p><p>With the Repeats parameter, the pattern can be set to repeat a specified number of times until it is retriggered. A setting of “inf“ will repeat the pattern indefinitely. <em>Hint</em>: This feature provides an excellent way of emulating the strum of a guitar or playing a chord as an arpeggio once or twice. Another interesting effect can be achieved by combining this feature with the Retrigger parameter, which we will explain in a moment. This can be used to create rhythmically generated arpeggios separated by pauses.</p><p>The Retrigger parameter resets the pattern so that it starts again from the beginning. Retriggering can be deactivated (Off), set to occur when new notes are pressed (Note) or set to occur at a specified song position or beat-time (Beat). Beat retriggering can be specified in terms of notes or bars and is aligned with song position. An LED in the upper right corner of the section indicates when the pattern has been retriggered.</p></section><section id="transposition-and-velocity-sections" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="26.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">26.1.2</span> Transposition and Velocity Sections</h3><p>The pattern generated by Arpeggiator can be transposed; the device’s transposition controls allow forcing this transposition into a specific major or minor key or (using the Transpose chooser’s Shift option) doing it in semitones. The distance between transposition steps is set in scale intervals (for Major and Minor transposition) or semitones (for Shift transposition) with the Distance control. Using the Steps parameter, you can choose the number of times the sequence is transposed. When Distance is set to a positive value, a setting of 8 Steps will transpose the sequence a total of eight times, playing it in higher notes each time. (When Distance is set to a negative value, the sequence will transpose lower each time.)</p><p>The dynamics of Arpeggiator are controlled using the velocity section. With Velocity set to “On“ and Target set to 0, for example, the sequence will gradually fade out, eventually reaching 0 velocity. The Decay control sets the amount of time Arpeggiator takes to reach the Target velocity. With Retrigger activated, retriggering of the sequence will also retrigger the velocity slope.</p><p><em>Tip</em>: The velocity section’s Retrigger option can be used in conjunction with Beat retriggering to add rhythm to the dynamic slope.</p></section></section><section id="cc-control" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="26.2"><span class="header-section-number">26.2</span> CC Control</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CCControl.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The CC Control Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>CC Control is a MIDI effect that lets you send MIDI CC messages to hardware devices. It has three hard-coded control knobs (Mod Wheel, Pitch Bend, Pressure), one customizable button for sending on/off or minimum/maximum values (Custom A), and twelve customizable control dials (Custom B - M).</p><p>The device’s hard-coded control knobs function as follows:</p><p><em>Mod Wheel</em> – sets the amount of modulation being applied by the receiving device.</p><p><em>Pitch Bend</em> – adjusts the pitch bend range in the receiving device.

Parameter values can be set using automation lanes or modulated in real time via the device’s control dials, which can be useful both for structuring and improvising with performances.</p><p>In the device’s title bar there are two toggles for switching between controls 1 - 8 and controls 9 - 16, as well as a Resend button which sends out all current MIDI CC values when clicked.</p><p>Note that if CC automation already exists for any CC message being sent from CC Control to a receiving device, MIDI data between the two is merged.</p></section><section id="chord" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="26.3"><span class="header-section-number">26.3</span> Chord</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Chord.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=306"><figcaption>The Chord Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>This effect assembles a chord, as the name implies, from each incoming note and up to six others of user-defined pitch. The Shift 1-6 knobs allow selecting the pitch of the notes that contribute to the chord from a range of +/- 36 semitones relative to the original. Setting Shift 1 to +4 semitones and Shift 2 to +7 semitones, for example, yields a major chord in which the incoming note is the root.</p><p>The Velocity control beneath each Shift knob makes further harmonic sculpting possible, given that the instrument allows for changes in volume or timbre as function of velocity. It is a relative control, with a range of 1 to 200 percent (100 percent defined as playing at a velocity equal to that of the incoming MIDI note). Use the Velocity controls to do anything from adding slight overtones to washing out most of the other chord elements.</p><p>The order in which pitches are added to the chord is inconsequential: The effect of a +12 semitone shift added with the Shift 1 control, for example, is equal in effect to a +12 semitone shift added with the Shift 6 control.</p><p>Note that no two notes of the same pitch can contribute to the chord, and that selecting the same shift value twice (e.g., +8 semitones on both Shift 2 and Shift 3) will result in the latter control appearing disabled, indicating that it is a duplicate and therefore not in use. Actually, there is no such thing as two notes with the same pitch playing at the same time within the entire Live universe.</p></section><section id="note-length" data-number="1.4"><h2 data-number="26.4"><span class="header-section-number">26.4</span> Note Length</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/NoteLength.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=264"><figcaption>The Note Length Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>Note Length alters the length of incoming MIDI notes. It can also be used to trigger notes from MIDI Note Off messages, instead of the usual Note On messages.</p><p>When the device is set to trigger from a Note On message, only the timing controls are available. The length of held notes can be adjusted in milliseconds or synced in relation to the song tempo. Gate defines the percentage of the Length value that notes should be held for. At 200 percent, the Gate parameter will double a note’s length.</p><p>When the device is set to trigger from a Note Off event (the moment at which a played note is released), the timing of an incoming note will be delayed by its length (because it will be starting at the point at which it would have been stopping). Note Length’s other settings will then determine the duration of the newly triggered note.</p><p>Three other parameters are available when the device is triggering from Note Off messages:</p><p><em>On/Off Balance</em> — This determines the velocity of the output note. It is a balance between the incoming note’s Note On and Note Off velocities. If your MIDI keyboard does not support MIDI Note Off velocity, you can just set this to zero.</p><p><em>Decay Time</em> — This is the time needed for an incoming note’s velocity to decay to zero. The decay begins immediately from the moment the device receives a MIDI Note On message. The value at the time of Note Off will become the velocity of the output MIDI note.</p><p><em>Key Scale</em> — The pitch of incoming notes can be used to alter the length of the output notes. With positive values, notes below C3 will be made progressively longer, and notes above C3 will be made shorter. Negative values will invert this relationship.</p></section><section id="pitch" data-number="1.5"><h2 data-number="26.5"><span class="header-section-number">26.5</span> Pitch</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Pitch.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=156"><figcaption>The Pitch Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>Pitch is a transposition tool that changes incoming note pitch by +/- 128 semitones.</p><p>The Range and Lowest controls act together to define a pitch range through which notes are allowed to pass. Notes outside of the defined pitch range will be blocked, and the effect’s LED light will flash when this happens.</p><p>Notes outside of the pitch range are limited based on their untransposed pitch, prior to the transposition stage of the effect.</p></section><section id="random" data-number="1.6"><h2 data-number="26.6"><span class="header-section-number">26.6</span> Random</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Random.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=188"><figcaption>The Random Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>Random adds an element of the unknown to the otherwise commonplace pitch parameter. The Chance control defines the likelihood that an incoming note’s pitch will be changed by a random value. You can think of it as being something like a dry/wet control for randomness.</p><p>The random value that determines the pitch change is created by two variables: The Choices control defines the number of different random notes possible, from a range of 1 to 24; the Scale control value is multiplied by the Choices control value, and the result dictates the pitches that random notes are allowed to have relative to that of the incoming note.</p><p>For example, if you play the note C3 with Chance set to 50 percent, Choices set to 1 and Scale set to 12, half of the resulting notes will play at C3 and half will play at C4. But with Chance set to 50 percent, Choices set to 12 and Scale set to 1, half of the resulting notes will play at C3 and half will play at one of any semitone that is between C#3 and C4.</p><p>These examples assume that the Sign buttons are set to “Add“ and the Mode button is set to “Rnd.“ The Sign controls decide whether the random alteration adds to the original note’s pitch, subtracts from it, or does a little of both. The LEDs above the Sign controls give you a visual idea of how output pitch compares with that of the original.</p><p>The Mode button determines whether the alteration will be random or, when set to “Alt,“ will cycle between the allowed output notes in a fixed order (sometimes known as “cycle round-robin“). The Chance control behaves a bit differently in Alt mode - at 100 percent, the next output note will always be the next note in the series. At 0 percent, the next output note will always be the incoming note.</p><p>For example, with Chance set to 100 percent, Choices set to 12 and Scale set to 1, playing C3 once will trigger C3, and each successive C3 will trigger the next semitone higher until the device reaches C4, at which point it will start over at C3. But with Chance set to 100 percent, Choices set to 2 and Scale set to 2, incoming C3s will alternate between C3 and D3. This setting is perfect for simulating upbow and downbow alternation with stringed instruments, or alternating right- and left-hand drum samples.</p><p>Hint: Try using the <em>Scale</em> effect after Random to constrain the output values to a specific harmonic range. Using Random’s Alt mode with the Scale device allows you to create a simple step-sequencer.</p></section><section id="scale" data-number="1.7"><h2 data-number="26.7"><span class="header-section-number">26.7</span> Scale</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Scale.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Scale Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>Scale alters incoming note pitch based on a scale mapping. Each incoming note is given an outgoing equivalent on the X-Y scale map of the effect: All incoming Cs, for example, might be converted to outgoing Ds.</p><p>The X-Y scale map is 12 squares in length and width, corresponding to the 12 notes in a full octave. Darker squares represent the black keys on a keyboard. The base of the diagonal scale (the lower left square) shown on the map can be changed using the Base control. The X-axis of the map shows incoming note values, and the Y-axis their outgoing equivalents. Use mouse-clicks to move or delete the blue squares, which define where an incoming note will be sent on the scale. (Deleting a note on the scale map means that it will no longer play.)</p><p>The Transpose slider can raise or lower the pitch of incoming MIDI notes by +/- 36 semitones. You could, for example, shift a melody written in C major to G major by setting Transpose to +7 st.</p><p>Fold makes it more convenient to create scales by automatically “folding“ back notes if their offset to the original note is greater than six semitones. For example, if Scale normally maps an incoming C3 to A3, enabling Fold will map C3 to A2 instead.</p><p>The Range and Lowest controls work together to define the note range within which scale mapping will take effect. Outside of the range defined by these controls, the Scale effect will be inapplicable, and the LED light will flash to indicate that some notes are not being processed by the effect, but are playing at their unaltered pitch.</p></section><section id="velocity" data-number="1.8"><h2 data-number="26.8"><span class="header-section-number">26.8</span> Velocity</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Velocity.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Velocity Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>Velocity can alter incoming MIDI note velocity values (1-127) in either a controlled or random manner. It can function on MIDI Note On (Velocity) or Note Off (Rel. Vel.) messages, or both, depending on the setting of the Operation chooser.</p><p>The Out Low and Out Hi knobs control the outgoing velocity (from 1 to 127), which is represented by the Y-axis of the X-Y display. Incoming velocities that are shown in the display are within the range chosen by the Range and Lowest controls, and are represented on the X-axis. The resulting curve shows how velocity is being altered by the effect.</p><p>If <em>Lowest</em> and <em>Out Low</em> are both set to zero, and Range and Out Hi are set to 127, the display will show a straight diagonal line that indicates the equivalent of an effect bypass: Softly played notes are being output quietly, and vice versa. If instead, Out Hi is set to zero and Out Low to 127, the slope of the line will be reversed, and softly played notes will actually produce the loudest output.</p><p>What happens to incoming notes that are outside of the range set with the Range and Lowest controls? This depends on which Mode is selected.</p><ul><li>Clip Mode does just what it says: It clips incoming note velocities so that they stay within the range.</li><li>Gate Mode removes incoming notes altogether if their velocities are outside of the range. You will see the little LED below the X-Y display flash when a note is blocked by gating.</li><li>In Fixed Mode, the Out Hi velocity defines all outgoing note velocities, regardless of incoming note velocity.</li></ul><p>The Random function adds or subtracts a random value to the all velocities, and is represented by a gray area on the display curve.</p><p>The Drive and Compand controls can be combined to create more complex curves. Compand is a simultaneous expanding and compressing tool. When set to values greater than zero, it forces incoming notes to the outer boundaries of the curve, making them play either loudly or softly. Compand values of less than zero, on the other hand, force outgoing velocity toward the mid-range. Drive pushes all values in the curve to the outer extremes. Use these two controls together to sculpt or even redefine the dynamic structure of a piece.</p></section></section></div>

The Working with Instruments and Effects chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#working-with-instruments-and-effects">‘Working with Instruments and Effects’</a>) explains the basics of using instruments in Live.</p><section id="analog" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="27.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.1</span> Analog</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Analog.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Analog Instrument.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Analog instrument is not available in the Intro, Lite and Standard Editions.)</p><p>Analog is a virtual analog synthesizer, created in collaboration with Applied Acoustics Systems. With this instrument, we have not attempted to emulate a specific vintage analog synthesizer but rather to combine different features of legendary vintage synthesizers into a modern instrument. Analog generates sound by simulating the different components of the synthesizer through physical modeling. This technology uses the laws of physics to reproduce how an object or system produces sound. In the case of Analog, mathematical equations describing how analog circuits function are solved in real time. Analog uses no sampling or wavetables; the sound is simply calculated in real time by the CPU according to the values of each parameter. This sound synthesis method ensures unmatched sound quality, realism, warmth and playing dynamics.</p><section id="architecture-and-interface" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="27.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.1</span> Architecture and Interface</h3><p>Analog’s signal flow is shown in the figure below:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogSignalFlow.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Diagram of Analog’s Signal Flow.</figcaption></figure><p>The primary sound sources of the synthesizer are two oscillators and a noise generator. These sources can be independently routed to two different multi-mode filters, which are each connected to an amplifier. Furthermore, the signal flow can be run through the filters in series or in parallel.</p><p>Analog also features two low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) which can modulate the oscillators, filters and amplifiers. Additionally, each filter and amplifier has its own envelope generator.</p><p>The Analog interface consists of two parts: the <em>display</em> surrounded on all sides by the <em>shell</em>. The shell contains the most important controls for a given section while the display updates to show parameter visualizations and additional controls for the section selected in the shell. In addition to the synthesis modules, there is a Global section that contains general performance parameters such as instrument volume, vibrato and polyphony, as well as an MPE section that includes controls for three MPE sources: pressure, slide and per-note pitch bend, which make it possible to shape Analog’s sound using an MPE-enabled controller.</p></section><section id="oscillators" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="27.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.2</span> Oscillators</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogOscillators.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Display and Shell Parameters for the two Oscillators.</figcaption></figure><p>Analog’s two oscillators use physical modelling to capture the character of vintage hardware oscillators. Because they use modelling instead of wavetables, they avoid aliasing.</p><p>Each oscillator can be turned on or off independently via the switch labelled Osc 1 or Osc 2 in the shell, and the oscillator’s output level is adjusted by the slider to the right of this activator.</p><p>The F1/F2 slider controls the balance of the oscillator’s output to each of the two filters. When the slider is at the center position, equal amounts of signal will be sent to both filters. When set all the way to the top or bottom, signal will only be sent to Filter 1 or Filter 2 respectively.</p><p>The Shape chooser selects the oscillator’s waveform. The choices are sine, sawtooth, rectangular and white noise. When rectangular is selected, the Pulse Width parameter is enabled in the display, which allows you to change the pulse width of the waveform. Low Width values result in a very narrow waveform, which tends to sound tinny or “pinched.“ At 100%, the waveform is a perfect square, resulting in only odd harmonics. The pulse width can also be modulated by an LFO, via the slider next to Width. Note that this parameter is only enabled when the corresponding LFO is enabled.</p><p>The Octave, Semi and Detune knobs in the shell function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes the oscillator by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune knob adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of three semitones (300 cents) up or down).</p><p>Oscillator pitch can be modulated according to the settings of the Pitch Mod and Pitch Env parameters in the display. The LFO slider sets the amount that the LFO modulates pitch. Again, this parameter is only enabled if the LFO is on. The Key slider controls how much the oscillator tuning is adjusted by changes in MIDI note pitch. The default value of 100% means that the oscillator will conform to a conventional equal tempered scale. Higher or lower values change the amount of space between the notes on the keyboard. At 0%, the oscillator is not modulated by note pitch at all. To get a sense of how this works, try leaving one of the oscillators at 100% and setting the other’s Key scaling to something just slightly different. Then play scales near middle C. Since C3 will always trigger the same frequency regardless of the Key value, the oscillators will get farther out of tune with each other the farther away from C3 you play.</p><p>The Pitch Env settings apply a ramp that modulates the oscillator’s pitch over time. Initial sets the starting pitch of the oscillator while Time adjusts how long it will take for the pitch to glide to its final value. You can adjust both parameters via the sliders or by adjusting the breakpoints in the envelope display.</p><p>The Sub/Sync parameters in the display allow you to apply either a sub-oscillator or a hard synchronization mode. When the Mode chooser is set to Sub, the Level slider sets the output level of an additional oscillator, tuned an octave below the main oscillator. The sub-oscillator produces a square wave when the main oscillator’s Shape control is set to rectangle or sawtooth and a sine wave when the main oscillator is set to sine. Note that the sub-oscillator is disabled when the main oscillator’s Shape is set to white noise.</p><p>When the Mode chooser is set to Sync, the oscillator’s waveform is restarted by an internal oscillator whose frequency is set by the Ratio slider. At 0%, the frequency of the internal oscillator and the audible oscillator match, so sync has no effect. As you increase the Ratio, the internal oscillator’s rate increases, which changes the harmonic content of the audible oscillator. For maximum analog nastiness, try mapping a modulation wheel or other MIDI controller to the Sync ratio.</p></section><section id="noise-generator" data-number="1.1.3"><h3 data-number="27.1.3"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.3</span> Noise Generator</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogNoise.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Analog’s Noise Generator.</figcaption></figure><p>The Noise generator produces white noise and includes its own -6db/octave low-pass filter. The generator can be turned on or off via the Noise switch in the shell. Its output level is adjusted by the slider to the right of this activator.</p><p>The F1/F2 slider controls the balance of the noise generator’s output to each of the two filters. When the slider is at the center position, equal amounts of signal will be sent to both filters. When set all the way to the top or bottom, signal will only be sent to Filter 1 or Filter 2 respectively.</p><p>The Color knob sets the frequency of the internal low-pass filter. Higher values result in more high-frequency content.</p><p>Note that Noise has only shell parameters, so adjusting them does not change what is shown in the display.</p></section><section id="filters" data-number="1.1.4"><h3 data-number="27.1.4"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.4</span> Filters</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogFilters.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Display and Shell Parameters for the two Filters.</figcaption></figure><p>Analog’s two multi-mode filters come equipped with a flexible routing architecture, multiple saturation options and a variety of modulation possibilities. As with the oscillators, all parameters can be set independently for each filter.</p><p>The Fil 1 and Fil 2 switches in the shell toggle the respective filter on and off. The chooser next to the filter activator selects the filter type from a selection of 2nd and 4th order low-pass, band-pass, notch, high-pass and formant filters.</p><p>The resonance frequency of the filter is adjusted with the Freq knob in the shell, while the amount of resonance is adjusted with the Reso control. When a formant filter is chosen in the chooser, the Reso control cycles between vowel sounds.</p><p>Below each mode chooser is an additional control which differs between the two filters. In Filter 1, the To F2 slider allows you to adjust the amount of Filter 1’s output that will be sent to Filter 2. The Follow switch below Filter 2’s mode chooser causes this filter’s cutoff frequency to follow the cutoff of Filter 1. If this is enabled, Filter 2’s cutoff knob controls the amount of offset between the two cutoff amounts. If any of Analog’s modulation sources are controlling Filter 1’s cutoff, Filter 2 will also be affected by them when Follow is enabled.</p><p>In addition to the envelope controls (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#envelopes">‘Envelopes’</a>), the displays for the filters contain various modulation parameters and the Drive chooser. Cutoff frequency and resonance can be independently modulated by LFO, note pitch and filter envelope via the sliders in the Freq Mod and Res Mod sections respectively. Positive modulation values will increase the cutoff or resonance amounts, while negative values will lower them.</p><p>The Drive chooser in the display selects the type of saturation applied to the filter output. The three Sym options apply symmetrical distortion, which means that the saturation behavior is the same for positive and negative values. The Asym modes result in asymmetrical saturation. For both mode types, higher numbers result in more distortion. Drive can be switched off entirely by selecting Off in the chooser. Experiment with the various options to get a sense of how they affect incoming signals.</p></section><section id="amplifiers" data-number="1.1.5"><h3 data-number="27.1.5"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.5</span> Amplifiers</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogAmps.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Display and Shell Parameters for the two Amplifiers.</figcaption></figure><p>After the filters, the signal is routed to an amplifier which further shapes the sound with an amplitude envelope and panning. All parameters can be set independently for each amplifier.</p><p>The Amp 1 and Amp 2 switches in the shell toggle the respective amplifier on and off, while the output level is controlled by the Level knob. The Pan knob sets the position of the amplifier’s output in the stereo field.</p><p>In addition to the envelope controls, the displays for the amplifiers contain various modulation parameters. The Pan and Level amounts can be independently modulated by LFO, note pitch and amp envelope via the sliders in the Pan Mod and Level Mod sections respectively. Note that, when using note pitch as the modulation source for Level, middle C will always sound the same regardless of the modulation amount. Positive values will cause the level to increase for higher notes.</p></section><section id="envelopes" data-number="1.1.6"><h3 data-number="27.1.6"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.6</span> Envelopes</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogEnvelopes.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Analog’s Envelope Parameters.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the pitch envelopes in the oscillator sections, Analog is equipped with independent envelopes for each filter and amplifier. All four of these envelopes have identical controls, which are housed entirely within the display. Each envelope is a standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) design and features velocity modulation and looping capabilities.</p><p>The attack time is set with the Attack slider. This time can also be modulated by velocity via the Att &lt; Vel slider. As you increase the Att &lt; Vel value, the attack time will become increasingly shorter at higher velocities.</p><p>The time it takes for the envelope to reach the sustain level after the attack phase is set by the Decay slider.</p><p>The Sustain slider sets the level at which the envelope will remain from the end of the decay phase to the release of the key. When this knob is turned all the way to the left, there is no sustain phase. With it turned all the way to the right, there is no decay phase.</p><p>The overall envelope level can be additionally modulated by velocity via the Env &lt; Vel slider.</p><p>The S.Time slider can cause the Sustain level to decrease even if a key remains depressed. Lower values cause the Sustain level to decrease more quickly.</p><p>Finally, the release time is set with the Release knob. This is the time it takes for the envelope to reach zero after the key is released.</p><p>The Slope switches toggle the shape of the envelope segments between linear and exponential. This change is also represented in the envelope visualization.</p><p>Normally, each new note triggers its own envelope from the beginning of the attack phase. With Legato enabled, a new note that is played while another note is already depressed will use the first note’s envelope, at its current position.</p><p>Enabling the Free switch causes the envelope to bypass its sustain phase and move directly from the decay phase to the release phase. This behavior is sometimes called “trigger“ mode because it produces notes of equal duration, regardless of how long the key is depressed. Free mode is ideal for percussive sounds.</p><p>The Loop chooser offers several options for repeating certain segments of the envelope while a key is depressed. When Off is selected, the envelope plays once through all of its segments without looping.</p><p>With AD-R selected, the envelope begins with the attack and decay phases as usual, but rather than maintaining the sustain level, the attack and decay phases will repeat until the note is released, at which point the release phase occurs. ADR-R mode is similar, but also includes the release phase in the loop for as long as the key is held.</p><p>Note that in both AD-R and ADR-R modes, enabling Free will cause notes to behave as if they’re permanently depressed.</p><p>ADS-R mode plays the envelope without looping, but plays the attack and release phases once more when the key is released. With short attack and release times, this mode can simulate instruments with audible dampers.</p></section><section id="lfos" data-number="1.1.7"><h3 data-number="27.1.7"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.7</span> LFOs</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogLFOs.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Display and Shell Parameters for the two LFOs.</figcaption></figure><p>Analog’s two LFOs can be used as modulation sources for the oscillators, filters and amplifiers. As with the other sections, each LFO has independent parameters.</p><p>The LFO 1 and LFO 2 switches in the shell toggle the respective LFO on and off, while the Rate knob sets the LFO’s speed. The switch next to this knob toggles the Rate between frequency in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions.</p><p>The Wave chooser in the display selects the waveform for the LFO. The choices are sine, triangle, rectangle and two types of noise. The first noise type steps between random values while the second uses smooth ramps. With Tri or Rect selected, the Width slider allows you to adjust the pulse width of the waveform. With Tri selected, low Width values shift the waveform towards an upwards sawtooth, while higher values result in a downward saw. At 50%, the waveform is a perfect triangle. The behavior is similar with the Rect setting. At 50%, the waveform is a perfect square wave, while lower and higher values result in negative or positive pulses, respectively. Note that Width is disabled when the LFO’s waveform is set to sine or the noise modes.</p><p>The Delay slider sets how long it will take for the LFO to start after the note begins, while Attack sets how long it takes the LFO to reach its full amplitude.</p><p>With Retrig enabled, the LFO restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered. The Offset slider adjusts the phase of the LFO’s waveform.</p></section><section id="global-parameters" data-number="1.1.8"><h3 data-number="27.1.8"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.8</span> Global Parameters</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogGlobal.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Display and Shell Parameters for the Global Options.</figcaption></figure><p>The Global shell and display parameters allow you to adjust Analog’s response to MIDI data and controls for performance parameters such as vibrato and glide.</p><p>The Volume control in the shell adjusts the overall output of the instrument. This is the instrument’s master level, and can boost or attenuate the output of the amplifier sections.</p><p>The Vib switch turns the vibrato effect on or off, while the percentage slider next to it adjusts the amplitude of the vibrato. Analog’s vibrato effect is essentially an additional LFO, but is hardwired to the pitch of both oscillators. The Rate slider sets the speed of the vibrato.</p><p>Turning on the vibrato effect activates the four additional Vibrato parameters in the display. The Delay slider sets how long it will take for the vibrato to start after the note begins, while Attack sets how long it takes for the vibrato to reach full intensity. The Error slider adds a certain amount of random deviation to the Rate, Amount, Delay and Attack parameters for the vibrato applied to each polyphonic voice. The Amt &lt; MW slider adjusts how much the modulation wheel will affect the vibrato intensity. This control is relative to the value set in the vibrato amount percentage slider in the shell.</p><p>The Uni switch in the shell turns on the unison effect, which stacks multiple voices for each note played. The Detune slider next to this switch adjusts the amount of tuning variation applied to each stacked voice.</p><p>Turning on the unison effect activates the two additional Unison parameters in the display. The Voices chooser selects between two or four stacked voices, while the Delay slider increases the lag time before each stacked voice is activated.</p><p>The Gli switch turns the glide effect on or off. This is used to make the pitch slide between notes rather than changing immediately. With Legato enabled, the sliding will only occur if the second note is played before the first note is released. The Time slider sets the overall speed of the slide.</p><p>Turning on the glide effect activates an additional Glide Mode chooser in the display. Selecting Const causes the glide time to be constant regardless of interval. Choosing Prop (proportional) causes the glide time to be proportional to the interval between the notes. Large intervals will glide slower than small intervals.</p><p>The four Quick Routing buttons on the left side of the display provide an easy way to quickly set up common parameter routings. The upper left option configures a parallel routing structure, with each oscillator feeding its own filter and amplifier exclusively. The upper right button is similar, but the oscillators each split their output evenly between the two filters. The bottom left option feeds both oscillators into Filter 1 and Amp 1, bypassing Filter 2 and Amp 2 entirely. Finally, the bottom right option configures a serial routing structure, with both oscillators feeding Filter 1, which is then fed exclusively to Filter 2 and Amp 2.</p><p>Note that the Quick Routing options do not affect any changes you may have made to the oscillator level, tuning or waveform parameters — they only adjust the routing of the oscillators to the filters and subsequent amplifiers.</p><p>The Keyboard section in the display contains all of Analog’s tuning and polyphony parameters. The Octave, Semi and Detune controls function as coarse and fine tuners. Octave transposes the entire instrument by octaves, while Semi transposes up or down in semitone increments. The Detune slider adjusts tuning in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of 50 cents up or down).</p><p>PB Range sets the range of pitch bend modulation in semitones.</p><p>Stretch simulates a technique known as stretch tuning, which is a common tuning modification made to electric and acoustic pianos. At 0%, Analog will play in equal temperament, which means that two notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s. Increasing the Stretch amount raises the pitch of upper notes while lowering the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound. Negative values simulate “negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes become flatter while lower notes become sharper.</p><p>The Error slider increases the amount of random tuning error applied to each note.</p><p>The Voices chooser sets the available polyphony, while Priority determines which notes will be cut off when the maximum polyphony is exceeded. When Priority is set to High, new notes that are higher than currently sustained notes will have priority, and notes will be cut off starting from the lowest pitch. Low is the opposite. A Priority setting of Last gives priority to the most recently played notes, cutting off the oldest notes as necessary.</p></section><section id="mpe-sources" data-number="1.1.9"><h3 data-number="27.1.9"><span class="header-section-number">27.1.9</span> MPE Sources</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/AnalogMPE.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Display Parameters for the MPE Sources.</figcaption></figure><p>Toggling the MPE switch in the Global section of the display reveals three MPE sources: Pressure, Slide, and NotePB (per-note pitch bend), which can be used to further transform Analog’s sound.</p><p>You can specify up to two different destinations where MPE pressure data will be routed using the two Pressure Destination choosers.

Each resonator can be toggled on or off via the switch in its tab. Keep in mind that if both resonators are turned off, no sound will be produced.</p><p>At the top of the Resonator tab, you will see a Resonance Type drop-down menu of resonant objects:</p><ul><li>Beam simulates the resonance properties of beams of different materials and sizes.</li><li>Marimba, a specialized variant of the Beam model, reproduces the characteristic tuning of marimba bar overtones which are produced as a result of the deep arch-cut of the bars.</li><li>String simulates the sound produced by strings of different materials and sizes.</li><li>Membrane is a model of a rectangular membrane (such as a drum head) with a variable size and construction.</li><li>Plate simulates sound production by a rectangular plate (a flat surface) of different materials and sizes.</li><li>Pipe simulates a cylindrical tube that is fully open at one end and has a variable opening at the other (adjusted with the Opening parameter.)</li><li>Tube simulates a cylindrical tube that is closed at both ends.</li></ul><p>Selecting an object adds a visualization of it to the X-Y Controller display.</p><p>Next to the Resonance Type drop-down is a Quality menu with options ranging from Eco to High. Quality controls the tradeoff between the sound quality of the resonators and CPU performance by reducing the number of overtones that are calculated. Eco uses minimal CPU resources, while High creates more sophisticated resonances. Note: the Pipe or Tube resonators do not offer a Quality menu.</p><p>Each resonator contains a copy button (1 → 2 in Resonator 1 and 2 → 1 in Resonator 2) that you can use to copy all the settings from one resonator to the other.</p><p>Using the X-Y Controller, you can click and drag the mouse horizontally to change the resonant object’s decay time, or vertically to change the value of the Material/Radius parameter.</p><p>The decay time adjusts the amount of the internal damping in the resonator and can also be adjusted using the Decay slider.</p><p>The Material slider adjusts the variation of damping at different frequencies. At lower values, low frequency components decay slower than high frequency components (which simulates objects made of wood, rubber, or nylon). At higher values, high frequency components decay slower (which simulates objects made of glass or metal).</p><p>In the Pipe and Tube resonators, a Radius parameter is available in place of the Material parameter. This slider adjusts the radius of the pipe or tube. As the radius increases, the decay time and high frequency sustain both increase. At very large sizes, the fundamental pitch of the resonator also changes.</p><p>The Decay and Material/Radius parameters can be modulated by note pitch and velocity via the Key and Vel sliders in the MIDI tab.</p><p>An additional Ratio parameter is available for the Membrane and Plate resonators, which adjusts the ratio of the object’s size along its x and y axes.</p><p>The Brightness control adjusts the amplitude of various frequency components. At higher values, higher frequencies are louder. This parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.</p><p>The Inharm knob adjusts the pitch of the resonator’s harmonics. At negative values, frequencies are compressed, increasing the amount of lower partials. At positive values, frequencies are stretched, increasing the amount of upper partials. Inharm can also be modulated by velocity via the slider in the MIDI tab. Note: this parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.</p><p>Opening, which is only available for the Pipe resonator, scales between an open and closed pipe. At 0%, the pipe is fully closed on one side, while at 100% the pipe is open at both ends. This parameter can also be modulated by velocity in the MIDI tab.</p><p>The Hit slider adjusts the location on the resonator at which the object is struck or otherwise activated. At 0%, the object is hit at its center. Higher values move the activation point closer to the edge. The Hit position can also be randomized by increasing the value of the Rnd slider. Note: this parameter is not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators.</p><p>Note Off determines the extent to which MIDI note off messages mute the resonance. At 0%, note offs are ignored, and the decay time is based only on the value of the Decay parameter. This is similar to how real-world mallet instruments behave, such as marimbas and glockenspiels. At 100%, the resonance is muted immediately at note off, regardless of the Decay time.</p><p>The Pos. L and Pos. R sliders adjust the location on the left and right resonator where the vibrations are measured. At 0%, the resonance is monitored at the object’s center. Higher values move the listening point closer to the edge. These parameters are not used with the Pipe or Tube resonators, which are always measured in the middle of their permanently open end.</p><section id="tuning-section" data-number="1.2.4.1"><h4 data-number="27.2.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.2.4.1</span> Tuning Section</h4><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CollisionTuning.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Resonator Tuning Parameters.</figcaption></figure><p>The Tune knob and Fine slider function as coarse and fine tuning controls.

The Key slider sets how much the resonator’s tuning is adjusted by changes in MIDI note pitch. The default value of 100% means that the resonator will conform to a conventional equal tempered scale. At 200%, each half step on the keyboard will result in a whole step change in tuning. At negative values, the resonator will drop in pitch as you play higher on the keyboard.</p><p>The Pitch Envelope parameters (Pitch Env and Time) apply a ramp that modulates the resonator’s pitch over time. Pitch Env sets the starting pitch while Time adjusts how long it will take the pitch to glide to its final value.

While Collision can produce extremely realistic simulations of conventional mallet instruments such as marimbas, vibraphones and glockenspiels, it is also very easy to “misuse“ the instrument’s parameters to produce sounds which could never be made by an acoustic instrument.</p><p>To program realistic instrument simulations, it helps to think about the chain of events that produces a sound on a mallet instrument (a marimba, for example), and then visualize those events as sections within Collision:</p><ul><li>a beater (Mallet) strikes a tuned bar (Resonator 1).</li><li>the tuned bar’s resonance is amplified by means of a resonating tube (Resonator 2).</li></ul><p>Thus the conventional model consists of the Mallet Exciter and the two resonators in a serial (1 &gt; 2) configuration.</p><p>Of course, to program <em>unrealistic</em> sounds, anything goes:</p><ul><li>try using the Noise Exciter, particularly with long envelope times, to create washy, quasi-granular textures. These parameters can also be used to simulate special acoustic effects such as bowed vibraphones or crystal glasses.</li><li>experiment with the resonators in parallel (1 + 2) configuration.</li><li>use the LFOs and MIDI controllers (including MPE-enabled ones) to modulate Collision’s parameters.</li></ul><p><em>A word of caution</em>: in many ways, Collision’s models are idealized versions of real-world objects. Consequently, it is very easy to program resonances that are much more sensitive to input than any physical resonator could be. Certain combinations of parameters can cause dramatic changes in volume. Make sure to keep output levels low when experimenting with new sounds.</p></section></section><section id="drift" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="27.3"><span class="header-section-number">27.3</span> Drift</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Drift.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Drift Instrument.</figcaption></figure><p>Drift is a versatile synthesizer with intuitive controls and a simple interface that is fully MPE-capable.

The Mono Thickness slider lets you adjust the relative volume of the four voices associated with each note. When Thickness is set to 0, only one voice will be played for a note.

It is based on the classic instruments of the seventies; each component has been modeled using cutting edge physical modeling technology to provide realistic and lively sounds.</p><p>Physical modeling uses the laws of physics to reproduce the behavior of an object. In other words, Electric solves, in real time, mathematical equations describing how its different components function. No sampling or wavetables are used in Electric; the sound is calculated in real time by the CPU according to the values of each parameter. Electric is more than a simple recreation of vintage instruments; its parameters can be tweaked to values not possible with the real instruments to get some truly amazing new sounds that still retain a warm acoustic quality.</p><section id="architecture-and-interface-2" data-number="1.4.1"><h3 data-number="27.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.4.1</span> Architecture and Interface</h3><p>The mechanism of the electric piano is actually quite simple. A note played on the keyboard activates a hammer that hits a fork. The sound of that fork is then amplified by a magnetic coil pickup and sent to the output, very much like an electric guitar. The fork is made of two parts, called the tine bar and tone bar. The tine bar is where the hammer hits the fork while the tone bar is a tuned metal resonator, sized appropriately to produce the correct pitch. Once the fork is activated, it will continue to resonate on its own for a long time. But releasing the key applies a damper to the fork, which mutes it more quickly.</p><p>The Electric interface is divided into four main sections: Hammer, Fork, Damper/Pickup, which contain parameters pertaining to the instrument’s tone and sound; and the Global section which contains parameters that affect overall behavior and performance, such as pitch bend and polyphony.</p><p>You can click on the individual sections to reveal all of their associated parameters, or you can click on the Hammer, Fork, or Damper/Pickup icons to toggle between those respective sections.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ElectricInstrumentIcons.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Electric’s Hammer, Fork, and Damper/Pickup Icons.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="hammer-section" data-number="1.4.2"><h3 data-number="27.4.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.4.2</span> Hammer Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ElectricHammerSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Electric’s Hammer Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The Hammer section contains the parameters related to the physical properties of the hammer itself, as well as how it’s affected by your playing.</p><p>The Stiffness knob adjusts the hardness of the hammer’s striking area. Higher values simulate a harder surface, which results in a brighter sound. Lower values mean a softer surface and a more mellow sound. Stiffness can also be modified by velocity and note pitch via the Vel and Key sliders in the bottom half of the display.</p><p>The Noise knob adjusts the amount of impact noise caused by the hammer striking the fork. In the Noise section in the bottom half of the display, the Pitch slider sets the center frequency of the noise pitch, while the Decay slider adjusts how long it takes for the noise to fade to silence. The Key slider controls how much the noise volume is determined by note pitch.</p><p>The Force section adjusts the intensity of the hammer’s impact on the fork. Low Amount values simulate a soft impact while high values result in a hard impact. Force can also be modified by velocity and note pitch, via the Vel and Key sliders.</p></section><section id="fork-section" data-number="1.4.3"><h3 data-number="27.4.3"><span class="header-section-number">27.4.3</span> Fork Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ElectricForkSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Electric’s Fork Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fork section contains knobs for both Tine and Tone parameters, which are the heart of Electric’s sound generating mechanism.</p><p>Tine controls the portion of the fork that is directly struck by the hammer.</p><p>The Color slider controls the relative amplitude of high and low partials in the tine’s spectrum.

Symmetry simulates the vertical position of the pickup. At 50%, the pickup is directly in front of the tine, which results in a brighter sound. Lower amounts move the pickup below the tine, while higher amounts move it above the tine. Distance controls how far the pickup is from the tine. Higher amounts increase the distance, while lower amounts move the pickup closer. Note that the sound becomes more overdriven as the pickup approaches the tine.</p><p>The Type R and W buttons switch between two different types of pickups. In the R position, Electric simulates electro-dynamic pickups, while W is based on an electro-static model.</p><p>The Input slider is used to adjust the amount of the fork’s signal that is fed to the pickup, which in turn affects the amount of distortion applied to the overall signal. The Output slider controls the amount of signal output by the pickup section. Different combinations of these two parameters can yield very different results. For example, a low amount of input with a high amount of output will produce a cleaner sound than a high input with a low output. The output level can be further modulated by note pitch via the Key slider.</p></section><section id="damper-parameters" data-number="1.4.4.2"><h4 data-number="27.4.4.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.4.4.2</span> Damper Parameters</h4><p>The metal forks in an electric piano are designed to sustain for a long time when a key is held. The mechanism that regulates this sustain is called the damper. When a key is pressed, that note’s damper is moved away from its fork. When the key is released, the damper is applied to the fork again to stop it from vibrating. But the dampers themselves make a small amount of sound, both when they are applied and when they are released. The Damper parameters simulate this characteristic noise.</p><p>The Tone slider adjusts the stiffness of the dampers. Lower values simulate soft dampers, which produces a mellower sound. Higher values increase the hardness of the dampers, producing a brighter sound. The overall amount of damper noise is adjusted with the Level slider.</p><p>The Att/Rel slider adjusts whether or not damper noise is present when the dampers are applied to the fork or when they are released. At -100, damper noise will only be heard during the note’s attack phase. At 100, the noise is present only during the release phase. In the center, an equal amount of noise will be present during both attack and release.</p></section></section><section id="global-section-1" data-number="1.4.5"><h3 data-number="27.4.5"><span class="header-section-number">27.4.5</span> Global Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ElectricGlobalSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Electric’s Global Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The Global section contains the parameters that relate to the overall behavior and performance of Electric.</p><p>The Volume knob sets Electric’s overall output level.</p><p>The Voices chooser sets the available polyphony.

Semi transposes the entire instrument up or down in semitone increments, while the Detune slider adjusts in increments of one cent (up to a maximum of 50 cents up or down).</p><p>Stretch simulates a technique known as stretch tuning, which is a common modification made to both electric and acoustic pianos and is an intrinsic part of their characteristic sound. At 0%, Electric will play in equal temperament, which means that two notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s. But because the actual resonance behavior of a vibrating tine or string differs from the theoretical model, equal temperament tends to sound “wrong“ on pianos. Stretch tuning attempts to correct this by sharpening the pitch of upper notes while flattening the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound. Negative values simulate “negative“ stretch tuning; upper notes become flatter while lower notes become sharper.</p><p>Pitch Bend sets the range in semitones of global pitch bend modulation, while Note PB sets the MPE per-note pitch bend range in semitones.</p></section></section><section id="external-instrument" data-number="1.5"><h2 data-number="27.5"><span class="header-section-number">27.5</span> External Instrument</h2><p>(Note: the External Instrument device is not available in the Lite Edition.)</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/ExternalInstrument.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=284"><figcaption>The External Instrument.</figcaption></figure><p>The External Instrument device is not an instrument itself, but rather a routing utility that allows you to easily integrate external (hardware) synthesizers and multitimbral plug-ins into your projects. It sends MIDI out and returns audio.</p><p>The two MIDI To choosers select the output to which the device will send MIDI data. The top chooser selects either a physical MIDI port (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#midi-port-inputs-and-outputs">‘MIDI Port Inputs and Outputs’</a>), or a multitimbral plug-in. If you select a MIDI port (for use with an external synthesizer), the second chooser’s options will be MIDI channel numbers.</p><p>If another track in your set contains a multitimbral plug-in, you can select this track in the top chooser. In this case, the second chooser allows you to select a specific MIDI channel in the plug-in.</p><p>The Audio From chooser provides options for returning the audio from the hardware synth or plug-in device. If you’re routing to a hardware synth, use this chooser to select the ports on your audio interface that are connected to the output of your synth. The available choices you’ll have will depend on the settings in the Audio Preferences.</p><p>If you’re routing to a multitimbral plug-in on another track in your Live Set, the Audio From chooser will list the auxiliary outputs in the plug-in. Note that the main outputs will be heard on the track that contains the instrument.</p><p>The Gain knob adjusts the audio level coming back from the sound source. This level should be set carefully to avoid clipping.</p><p>Since external devices can introduce latency that Live cannot automatically detect, you can manually compensate for any delays by adjusting the Hardware Latency slider. The button next to this slider allows you to set your latency compensation amount in either milliseconds or samples. If your external device connects to Live via a digital connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in samples, which ensures that the number of samples you specify will be retained even when changing the sample rate. If your external device connects to Live via an analog connection, you will want to adjust your latency settings in milliseconds, which ensures that the amount of time you specify will be retained when changing the sample rate. Note that adjusting in samples gives you finer control, so even in cases when you’re working with analog devices, you may want to “fine tune“ your latency in samples in order to achieve the lowest possible latency. In this case, be sure to switch back to milliseconds before changing your sample rate. Any latency introduced by devices within Live will be compensated for automatically, so the slider will be disabled when using the External Instrument Device to route internally.</p><p>Note: If the Delay Compensation option (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#device-delay-compensation">‘Device Delay Compensation’</a>) is unchecked in the Options menu, the Hardware Latency slider is disabled.</p><p>For more detailed information about routing scenarios with the External Instrument device, please see the Routing and I/O chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#routing-and-i-o">‘Routing and I/O’</a>).</p></section><section id="impulse" data-number="1.6"><h2 data-number="27.6"><span class="header-section-number">27.6</span> Impulse</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Impulse.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Impulse Instrument.</figcaption></figure><p>Impulse is a drum sampler with complex modulation capabilities.

Loaded samples can be deleted with your computer keyboard’s <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> key.</p><p>Imported samples are automatically mapped onto your MIDI keyboard, providing that it is plugged in and acknowledged by Live. C3 on the keyboard will trigger the leftmost sample, and the other samples will follow suit in the octave from C3 to C4. Impulse’s eight slots will appear labeled in the MIDI Editor’s key tracks (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/editing-midi-notes-and-velocities/#editing-midi-notes-and-velocities">‘Editing MIDI Notes and Velocities’</a>) when the Fold button is active, even if the given key track is void of MIDI notes. Mapping can be transposed from the default by applying a Pitch device (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-midi-effect-reference/#pitch">‘Pitch’</a>), or it can be rearranged by applying a Scale device (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-midi-effect-reference/#scale">‘Scale’</a>).</p><p>Each of the eight samples has a proprietary set of parameters, located in the area below the sample slots and visible when the sample is clicked. Adjustments to sample settings are only captured once you hit a new note — they do not affect currently playing notes. Note that this behavior also defines how Impulse reacts to parameter changes from clip envelopes or automation, which are applied once a new note starts.

Extreme Drive settings on low-pitched sounds will produce the typical, overdriven analog synth drum sounds.</p><p>The envelope can be adjusted using the Decay control, which can be set to a maximum of 10.0 seconds.

Meld is designed to produce expressive, unfamiliar sounds guided by musical intention rather than technical detail.</p><section id="general-overview" data-number="1.7.1"><h3 data-number="27.7.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.7.1</span> General Overview</h3><p>Meld’s dual-layer architecture can use up to two polyphonic synth engines at once. Its interface is divided into four main sections: the engines, the modulation section, the filters, and the global mix controls. This modular-inspired configuration makes it easy to add texture and movement to your sounds, but also to produce and capture musical surprises. To get familiar with some of Meld’s possibilities, try combining different waveform types and playing with each engine’s modulation macros. For more control, try mapping an engine’s parameters to its Modulation Matrix, or automating the device’s macro knobs using an LFO device. The more you experiment with the interaction between Meld’s two layers, the more you’ll make the device your own.</p><p>Meld can be expanded using the Toggle Expanded View button in the device header. When in expanded view, all possible modulation targets and sources will be shown. The A and B toggles can be used to switch between each engine. Parameter modulation values can be copied from one engine to another using the Copy to A and Copy to B buttons. Clicking the X button will erase all active modulation values.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MeldExpandedView.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Meld in Expanded View.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="oscillators-1" data-number="1.7.2"><h3 data-number="27.7.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.7.2</span> Oscillators</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MeldOscillators.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Meld’s Oscillators.</figcaption></figure><p>Meld’s two engines can be turned on or off independently via switches in the Engines section. Deactivating one of Meld’s engines will deactivate its associated filter in the device’s Filters section. (Note: a filter can be turned on or off without affecting the activation of the engine it’s linked to.)</p><p>Each of Meld’s engines has three pitch controls (Octaves, Semitones, and Cents). When the Use Current Scale toggle is activated, the semitone indicator (st) switches to scale degrees (sd). You can use these pitch controls to add harmonic depth to your sound, for example by transposing an engine up an octave or a fifth, or by subtly detuning it in cents.</p><p>Engines A and B each have a selection of twenty-four oscillator types to choose from, including six scale aware oscillators marked with a (♭♯) (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#settings-tab">‘Settings Tab’</a>). These range from simple sine wave generation oscillators to layered wave swarms, complex frequency modulation, noise looping, and ambient sound generation algorithms.

All four of the oscillator macro knobs can be assigned to a MIDI controller for live performance or to the LFO device for automated modulation. They can also be modulated internally, using the Modulation Matrix.</p><p>The Basic Shapes oscillator has two macro controls, Shape and Tone. Shape morphs the oscillator’s waveform between a sine, triangle, saw, and square wave. Tone changes the pulse width of the source wave.</p><p>The Dual Basic Shapes oscillator has two macro controls, Shape and Detune. Shape morphs the oscillator’s waveform through sine, triangle, saw, and square wave shapes. Detune adds a copy of this initial wave and detunes it.</p><p>The Noisy Shapes oscillator has two macro controls, Shape and Rough. Shape morphs the oscillator’s waveform through sine, triangle, saw, and square wave shapes. Rough adds noise distortion to this source wave.</p><p>The Square Sync oscillator has two macro controls, Freq 1 and Freq 2. These two controls change the frequencies of the oscillator’s two synced square waves.</p><p>The Square 5th oscillator has two macro controls, 5th Amt and P Width. 5th Amt morphs the oscillator’s initial square wave to a second square wave that is a perfect fifth above it. P Width changes the pulse width of the square wave being generated.</p><p>The Sub oscillator has two macro controls, Tone and Aux. Tone morphs the oscillator’s initial sine wave into a square wave. Aux adds a lower subharmonic sine wave to the initial sine wave being generated.</p><p>The Swarm Sine, Swarm Triangle, Swarm Saw, and Swarm Square oscillators have two macro controls, Motion and Spacing. Motion adds modulation to the wave swarm being produced. Spacing fades between increasingly complex chords as the amount applied is increased.</p><p>The Harmonic Fm oscillator has two macro controls, Amount and Ratio, which change the modulation amount and ratio in the frequency modulation algorithm.</p><p>The Fold Fm oscillator has two macro controls, Amount and Shape. Amount changes the modulation amount in the frequency modulation algorithm and Shape changes the shape of its carrier wave.</p><p>The Squelch oscillator has two macro controls, Index and Feedback. Index changes the modulation depth of the frequency modulation algorithm and Feedback changes the amount of signal being fed back into the device.</p><p>The Simple Fm oscillator has two macro controls, Amount and Index, which change the modulation amount and depth in the frequency modulation algorithm.</p><p>The Chip oscillator has two macro controls, Tone and Rate. Tone changes the oscillator’s pitch and pulse width. Rate changes the speed of the chip interval being used.</p><p>The Shepard’s Pi oscillator has two macro controls, Rate and Width. Rate changes the speed and direction of the oscillator. Values 0.0 through 49.9 produce falling movements, and values 50.1 through 100.0 produce ascending movements. At 50.0, no movement is produced. Width changes the number of octaves being used by the oscillator.</p><p>The Tarp oscillator has two macro controls, Decay and Tone, which change the algorithm’s decay amount and tonality.</p><p>The Extratone oscillator has two macro controls, Pitch and Env Amount, which change the oscillator’s pitch and envelope behavior.</p><p>The Noise Loop oscillator has two macro controls, Rate and Fade. Rate sets the rate at which fragments of different noise loops occur. At higher values, the oscillator produces noise. Fade dials in the grain or roughness of the noise.</p><p>The Filtered Noise oscillator has two macro controls, Freq and Width, which change the oscillator’s filter frequency and width.</p><p>The Bitgrunge oscillator has two macro controls, Freq and Mult. Freq adjusts the frequency of the square wave being produced. Mult adjusts the number of sub-octaves being generated in relation to this initial square wave. At its maximum setting, no sub-octaves are generated. At its minimum, a large number of sub-octaves is generated.</p><p>The Crackle oscillator has two macro controls, Density and Intensity. Density sets the average rate of crackles being produced. Intensity adjusts the distribution of loudness and brightness within the crackles.</p><p>The Rain oscillator has two macro controls, Tone and Rate. Tone sets the resonance of the raindrop and wind sounds being generated. This makes the oscillator tonal and dependent on the notes you play. Rate sets the density of raindrop sounds being generated.</p><p>The Bubble oscillator has two macro controls, Density and Spread. Density sets the rate of bubble generation and Spread sets the randomness of the size of the bubbles being produced.</p></section><section id="envelopes-tab" data-number="1.7.4"><h3 data-number="27.7.4"><span class="header-section-number">27.7.4</span> Envelopes Tab</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MeldADSREnvelope.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Engine A’s Amplitude Envelope.</figcaption></figure><p>Each of Meld’s envelopes has Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release controls.

Each filter has two macro controls, which change with the filter type selected.</p><p>The most common filter macro controls in Meld are Q and Drive. Q adjusts the emphasis of the frequencies around a filter’s cutoff frequency. Drive applies saturation to the input signal before it passes through the filter, which is useful for producing distortion.</p><p>The SVF 12dB and 24dB filters are variable state filters. The L-B-H-N macro control morphs through this filter type’s four possible configurations: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, and notch.</p><p>The MS2 filters are modeled on a Sallen-Key design from a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth, which applies soft clipping to limit resonance. They are available in low-pass and high-pass configurations in Meld.</p><p>The OSR filter is modeled on a variable state filter from a rare British monosynth whose resonance is limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. It is available in a band-pass configuration in Meld.</p><p>LP Crunch 12dB is a dual-mode low-pass filter that feeds the distortion it produces back into itself.</p><p>The LP Switched Res filter is modeled on low-pass filters whose resistors are replaced with fast switches to produce downsampling artifacts. The Lofi macro control changes the frequency of the filter’s resistors. If set to a high value, the filter produces a clean sound. If set to a low value, it produces a more crushed sound.</p><p>Filther is modeled on a low-pass filter that applies distortion to a signal’s input and output. It uses a hard diode clipper on the input signal and soft saturation on the output signal.</p><p>The Eq Peak and Eq Notch filters are peak and notch filters that apply gain and width to an input signal. The Eq Peak filter’s Boost macro control boosts frequencies around the filter’s cutoff point. The Eq Notch filter’s Cut macro control cuts frequencies around the filter’s cutoff point.</p><p>The Phaser filter is a six-stage delayless inverted feedback phaser with variable feedback and notch spacing. The Phaser filter’s Feedback macro control sets the amount of output being fed back into the filter’s input. The Spread macro control adjusts the spacing between the filter’s notches in the frequency spectrum.</p><p>The Redux filter is a resampler and bitcrusher with a variable sample rate, quantization, and control over the amount of resampling artifacts it produces. The Crush macro control sets the bit depth of the filter’s output. The Lofi macro control adjusts the mix between a filtered, sample rate-reduced version of the signal and the unfiltered, downsampled artifacts Redux has produced.</p><p>The Vowel filter is a formant filter that mimics the characteristics of vowels being pronounced, with various configurations that can be morphed through using the filter’s Morph macro control.</p><p>The Comb + and Comb - filters are feedforward and feedback filters.

On the left side, you will find four oscillator sections, and on the right side from top to bottom, the LFO, the filter section, the pitch section and the global parameters. If you change one of the shell parameters, the display in the center will automatically show the details of the relevant section. When creating your own sounds, for example, you can conveniently access the level and frequency of all oscillators at once via the shell, and then adjust each individual oscillator’s envelope, waveform and other parameters in its display.</p><p>Operator can be folded with the triangular button at its upper left.

However, in order to simplify sound design and to create a wider range of possible sounds, we designed Operator to produce a variety of other waveforms, including two types of noise. You can also draw your own waveforms via a partial editor. The instrument is made complete with an LFO, a pitch envelope and a filter section. Note that lots of “classic“ FM synthesizers create fantastic sounds without using filters at all, so we suggest exploring the possibilities of FM without the filter at first, and adding it later if necessary.</p><p>Operator will keep you busy if you want to dive deep into sound design!

The first of these waveforms is a pure, mathematical sine wave, which is usually the first choice for many FM timbres. We also added “Sine 4 Bit“ and “Sine 8 Bit“ to provide the retro sound adored by C64 fans, and “Saw D“ and “Square D“ digital waveforms, which are especially good for digital bass sounds. The square, triangle and sawtooth waveforms are resynthesized approximations of the ideal shape. The numbers included in the displayed name (e.g., “Square 6“) define how many harmonics are used for the resynthesis. Lower numbers sound mellower and are less likely to create aliasing when used on high pitches. There are also two built-in noise waveforms. The first, “Noise Looped,“ is a looping sample of noise. For truly random noise, choose “Noise White.“</p></section><section id="user-waveforms" data-number="1.8.2.2"><h4 data-number="27.8.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.8.2.2</span> User Waveforms</h4><p>The “User“ entry in the Wave chooser allows you to create your own waveforms by drawing the amplitudes of the oscillator’s harmonics. You can also select one of the built-in waveforms and then edit it in the same way. The small display next to the Wave chooser gives a realtime overview of your waveform.</p><p>When your mouse is over the Oscillator display area, the cursor will change to a pencil. Drawing in the display area then raises or lowers the amplitudes of the harmonics. As you adjust the amplitudes, the Status Bar will show the number of the harmonic you’re adjusting as well as its amplitude. Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and dragging will constrain horizontal mouse movement, allowing you to adjust the amplitude of only one harmonic at a time.</p><p>You can switch between editing the first 16, 32 or 64 harmonics via the switches to the right of the display. Higher harmonics can be generated by repeating the drawn partials with a gradual fadeout, based on the settings in the Repeat chooser. Low Repeat values result in a brighter sound, while higher values result in more high-end roll-off and a more prominent fundamental. With Repeat off, partials above the 16th, 32nd or 64th harmonic are truncated.</p><p>The <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu on the harmonics display offers options for editing only the even or odd harmonics. This is set to “All“ by default. The context menu also offers an option to toggle Normalize on or off. When enabled, the oscillator’s overall output level is maintained as you draw additional harmonics. When disabled, additional harmonics add additional level.

An oscillator’s frequency usually follows that of played notes, but for some sounds it might be useful to set one or more oscillators to fixed frequencies. This can be done for each individual oscillator by activating the Fixed option. This allows the creation of sounds in which only the timbre will vary when different notes are played, but the tuning will stay the same. Fixed Mode would be useful, for example, in creating live drum sounds. Fixed Mode also allows producing very low frequencies down to 0.1 Hz. Note that when Fixed Mode is active, the frequency of the oscillator is controlled in the shell with the Frequency (Freq) and Multiplier (Multi) controls.</p><p>Operator includes a special Osc &lt; Vel control for each oscillator that allows altering frequency as a function of velocity. This feature can be very useful when working with sequenced sounds in which the velocity of each note can be adjusted carefully. Part of this functionality is the adjacent Q (Quantize) button. If this control is activated, the frequency will only move in whole numbers, just as if the Coarse control were being manually adjusted. If quantize is not activated, the frequency will be shifted in an unquantized manner, leading to detuned or inharmonic sounds (which very well could be exactly what you want…).</p><p>The amplitude of an oscillator depends on the Level setting of the oscillator in the shell and on its envelope, which is shown and edited when the Envelope display is visible. The envelopes can also be modified by note velocity and note pitch with the Vel and Key parameters available in the Envelope section of each oscillator’s display.</p><p>The phase of each oscillator can be adjusted using the Phase control in its display. With the R (Retrigger) button enabled, the waveform restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered. With R disabled, the oscillator is free-running.</p><p>As explained earlier oscillators can modulate each other when set up to do so with the global display’s algorithms. When an oscillator is modulating another oscillator, two main properties define the result: the amplitude of the modulating oscillator and the frequency ratio between both oscillators. Any oscillator that is not modulated by another oscillator can modulate itself, via the Feedback parameter in its display.</p></section><section id="aliasing" data-number="1.8.2.4"><h4 data-number="27.8.2.4"><span class="header-section-number">27.8.2.4</span> Aliasing</h4><p>Aliasing distortion is a common side effect of all digital synthesis and is the result of the finite sample rate and precision of digital systems. It mostly occurs at high frequencies. FM synthesis is especially likely to produce this kind of effect, since one can easily create sounds with lots of high harmonics. This also means that more complex oscillator waveforms, such as “Saw 32,“ tend to be more sensitive to aliasing than pure sine waves. Aliasing is a two-fold beast: A bit of it can be exactly what is needed to create a cool sound, yet a bit too much can make the timbre unplayable, as the perception of pitch is lost when high notes suddenly fold back into arbitrary pitches. Operator minimizes aliasing by working in a high-quality Antialias mode. This is on by default for new patches, but can be turned off in the global section. The Tone parameter in the global section also allows for controlling aliasing. Its effect is sometimes similar to a low-pass filter, but this depends on the nature of the sound itself and cannot generally be predicted. If you want to familiarize yourself with the sound of aliasing, turn Tone up fully and play a few very high notes. You will most likely notice that some notes sound completely different from other notes. Now, turn Tone down and the effect will be reduced, but the sound will be less bright.</p></section></section><section id="lfo-section-1" data-number="1.8.3"><h3 data-number="27.8.3"><span class="header-section-number">27.8.3</span> LFO Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/OperatorLfo.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Operator’s LFO Display and Shell Parameters.</figcaption></figure><p>The LFO in Operator can practically be thought of as a fifth oscillator. It runs at audio rates, and it modulates the frequency of the other oscillators. It is possible to switch LFO modulation on or off for each individual oscillator (and the filter) using the Dest. A buttons in the LFO’s display. The intensity of the LFO’s modulation of these targets can be adjusted by the Dest. A slider. The LFO can also be turned off entirely if it is unused.</p><p>The Dest. B chooser allows the LFO to modulate an additional parameter. The intensity of this modulation is determined by the Dest. B slider.</p><p>The LFO offers a choice of classic LFO waveforms, sample and hold (S&amp;H), and noise. Sample and hold uses random numbers chosen at the rate of the LFO, creating the random steps useful for typical retro-futuristic sci-fi sounds. The noise waveform is simply band-pass filtered noise.</p><p>Tip: FM synthesis can be used to create fantastic percussion sounds, and using the LFO with the noise waveform is the key to great hi-hats and snares.</p><p>The frequency of the LFO is determined by the LFO Rate control in the shell, as well as the low/high/sync setting of the adjacent LFO Range chooser. The frequency of the LFO can follow note pitch, be fixed or be set to something in between. This is defined by the Rate &lt; Key parameter in the LFO’s display. With the R (Retrigger) button enabled, the LFO restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered. With R disabled, the LFO is free-running.</p><p>The overall intensity of the LFO is set by the LFO Amount control in the shell. This parameter scales both the Dest. A and B amounts and can be modulated by note velocity via the display’s Amt &lt; Vel control. The LFO’s intensity is also affected by its envelope.</p></section><section id="envelopes-1" data-number="1.8.4"><h3 data-number="27.8.4"><span class="header-section-number">27.8.4</span> Envelopes</h3><p>Operator has seven envelopes: one for each oscillator, a filter envelope, a pitch envelope and an envelope for the LFO. All envelopes feature some special looping modes. Additionally, the filter and pitch envelopes have adjustable slopes.</p><p>Each oscillator’s volume envelope is defined by six parameters: three rates and three levels. A rate is the time it takes to go from one level to the next. For instance, a typical pad sound starts with the initial level “-inf dB“ (which is silence), moves with an attack rate to its peak level, moves from there to the sustain level with a decay rate, and then finally, after note-off occurs, back to “-inf dB“ at the release rate. Operator’s display provides a good overview of the actual shape of any particular envelope and lets you directly adjust the curve by clicking on a breakpoint and dragging. The breakpoints retain their selection after clicking, allowing them to be adjusted with the keyboard’s cursor keys, if desired.</p><p>Hint: Envelope shapes can be copied and pasted from one oscillator to another in Operator using the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu.</p><p>As mentioned above, the filter and pitch envelopes also have adjustable slopes. Clicking on the diamonds between the breakpoints allows you to adjust the slope of the envelope segments. Positive slope values cause the envelope to move quickly at the beginning, then slower. Negative slope values cause the envelope to remain flat for longer, then move faster at the end. A slope of zero is linear; the envelope will move at the same rate throughout the segment.</p><p>With FM synthesis, it is possible to create spectacular, endless, permuting sounds; the key to doing this is looping envelopes. Loop Mode can be activated in the lower left corner of the display. If an envelope in Operator is in Loop Mode and reaches sustain level while the note is still being held, it will be retriggered. The rate for this movement is defined by the Loop Time parameter. (Note that envelopes in Loop Mode can loop very quickly and can therefore be used to achieve effects that one would not normally expect from an envelope generator.)</p><p>While Loop Mode is good for textures and experimental sounds, Operator also includes Beat and Sync Modes, which provide a simple way of creating rhythmical sounds. If set to Beat Mode, an envelope will restart after the beat time selected from the Repeat chooser. In Beat Mode, the repeat time is defined in fractions of song time, but notes are not quantized. If you play a note a bit out of sync, it will repeat perfectly but stay out of sync. In Sync Mode however, the first repetition is quantized to the nearest 16th note and, as a result, all following repetitions are synced to the song tempo. Note that Sync Mode only works if the song is playing, and otherwise it will behave like Beat Mode.</p><p>Note: To avoid the audible clicks caused by restarting from its initial level, a looped envelope will restart from its actual level and move with the set attack rate to peak level.</p><p>There is also a mode called Trigger that is ideal for working with percussive sounds. In this mode, note off is ignored. This means that the length of time a key is held has no effect on the length of the sound.</p><p>The rates of all the envelopes in Operator can be scaled in unison by the Time control in the global section of the shell. Note that beat-time values in Beat and Sync Modes are not influenced by the global Time parameter. Envelope rates can be further modified by note pitch, as dictated by the Time &lt; Key parameter in the global section’s display. The rate of an individual envelope can also be modified by velocity using the Time &lt; Vel parameter. These modulations in conjunction with the loop feature can be used to create very, very complex things…</p><p>The pitch envelope can be turned on or off for each individual oscillator and for the LFO using the Destination A-D and LFO buttons in its display. The intensity of this envelope’s modulation of these targets can be adjusted by the Dest. A slider and the envelope can be turned off altogether via the switch in the pitch section of the shell.</p><p>Like the LFO, the pitch envelope can modulate an additional parameter as chosen by the Dest. B chooser. The intensity of this modulation is determined by the Amt. B slider and the main Pitch Env value.</p><p>The pitch and filter envelopes each have an additional parameter called End, which determines the level the envelope will move to after the key is released. The rate of this envelope segment is determined by the release time.</p><p>Tip: If the pitch envelope is only applied to the LFO and is looping, it can serve as another LFO, modulating the rate of the first. And, since the envelope of the LFO itself can loop, it can serve as a third LFO modulating the intensity of the first!</p></section><section id="filter-section-1" data-number="1.8.5"><h3 data-number="27.8.5"><span class="header-section-number">27.8.5</span> Filter Section</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/OperatorFilter.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Operator’s Filter Display and Shell Parameters.</figcaption></figure><p>Operator’s filters can be very useful for modifying the sonically rich timbres created by the oscillators. And, since the oscillators also provide you with the classic waveforms of analog synthesizers, you can very easily build a subtractive synthesizer with them.</p><p>Operator offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers.</p><p>The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ Eight (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#eq-eight">‘EQ Eight’</a>). This is available for all of the filter types.</p><p>The OSR circuit option is a state-variable type with resonance limited by a unique hard-clipping diode. This is modeled on the filters used in a somewhat rare British monosynth, and is available for all filter types.</p><p>The MS2 circuit option uses a Sallen-Key design and soft clipping to limit resonance. It is modeled on the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point.</p><p>When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter.</p><p>The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.</p><p>Tip: you can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via dedicated options in the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu of the Morph slider.</p><p>The Envelope and Filter buttons in the filter section’s display area toggle between showing the filter envelope and its frequency response. Filter cutoff frequency and resonance can be adjusted in the shell or by dragging the filter response curve in the display area. Filter frequency can also be modulated by the following:</p><ul><li>note velocity, via the Freq &lt; Vel control in the filter’s display</li><li>note pitch, via the Freq &lt; Key control in the filter’s display</li><li>filter envelope, via the Envelope control in the filter’s display.</li><li>LFO, done either by enabling the Dest. A “FIL“ switch in the LFO’s display, or by setting Dest. B to Filter Freq.</li></ul><p>Tip: The <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu on the Frequency knob contains an entry called “Play by Key.“ This automatically configures the filter for optimal key tracking by setting Freq &lt; Key to 100% and setting the cutoff to 466 Hz.</p><p>The filter’s signal can be routed through a waveshaper, whose curve type can be selected via the Shaper chooser. The Shaper Drive (Shp. Drive) slider boosts or attenuates the signal level being sent to the waveshaper, while the overall balance between the dry and processed signals can be adjusted with the Dry/Wet control. With this set to 0%, the shaper and shaper drive parameters are bypassed.</p><section id="legacy-filters" data-number="1.8.5.1"><h4 data-number="27.8.5.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.8.5.1</span> Legacy Filters</h4><p>If you open a Set that was created in a version of Live older than version 9.5, any instance of Operator in the Set will open with legacy filters in place of the filters discussed previously. These consist of 12 dB or 24 dB low-pass, band-pass and high-pass filters, as well as a notch filter, and do not feature a Drive control. Each Operator loaded with the legacy filters shows an Upgrade button in the title bar. Pressing this button will permanently switch the filter selection to the newer models for that instance of Operator.

Additionally, the global display area provides a comprehensive set of modulation routing controls.</p><p>The maximum number of Operator voices (notes) playing simultaneously can be adjusted with the Voices parameter in the global display. Ideally, one would want to leave this setting high enough so that no voices would be turned off while playing, however a setting between 6 and 12 is usually more realistic when considering CPU power.</p><p>Tip: Some sounds should play monophonically by nature, which means that they should only use a single voice. (A flute is a good example.) In these cases, you can set Voices to 1. If Voices is set to 1, another effect occurs: Overlapping voices will be played legato, which means that the envelopes will not be retriggered from voice to voice, and only pitch will change.</p><p>A global Volume control for the instrument can be found in the global section of the shell, and a Pan control is located in the global section’s display. Pan can be modulated by note pitch or a random factor, using the adjacent Pan &lt; Key and Pan &lt; Rnd controls, respectively.</p><p>The center of the global display allows for a wide variety of internal MIDI mappings. The MIDI controllers Velocity, Key, Aftertouch, Pitch Bend and Mod Wheel can be mapped to two destinations each, with independent modulation intensities set via the Amount sliders. Note that Time &lt; Key and pitch bend range have fixed assignments, although both modulation sources can still be routed to an additional target.

When this function is activated, new notes will start with the pitch of the last note played and then slide gradually to their own played pitch. Glide can be turned on or off and adjusted with the Glide Time control in the pitch display.</p><p>Operator also offers a special Spread parameter that creates a rich stereo chorus by using two voices per note and panning one to the left and one to the right. The two voices are detuned, and the amount of detuning can be adjusted with the Spread control in the pitch section of the shell.</p><p>Tip: Whether or not spread is applied to a particular note depends upon the setting of the Spread parameter during the note-on event. To achieve special effects, you could, for instance, create a sequence where Spread is 0 most of the time and turned on only for some notes. These notes will then play in stereo, while the others will play mono.

Coarse sets the ratio in whole numbers, creating a harmonic relationship.</p><p>Osc Fine Frequency (Fine) — The relationship between oscillator frequency and note pitch is defined by the Coarse and Fine parameters. Fine sets the ratio in fractions of whole numbers, creating an inharmonic relationship.</p><p>Osc Fixed Frequency On (Fixed) — In Fixed Mode, oscillators do not respond to note pitch but instead play a fixed frequency.</p><p>Osc Fixed Frequency (Freq) — This is the frequency of the oscillator in Hertz. This frequency is constant, regardless of note pitch.</p><p>Osc Fixed Multiplier (Multi) — This is used to adjust the range of the fixed frequency. Multiply this value with the value of the oscillator’s Freq knob to get actual frequency in Hz.</p><p>Osc Output Level (Level) — This sets the output level of the oscillator. If this oscillator is modulating another, its level has significant influence on the resulting timbre.

You can then edit them via the harmonics editor.</p><p>Osc Feedback (Feedback) — An oscillator can modulate itself if it is not modulated by another oscillator. The modulation is dependent not only on the setting of the feedback control but also on the oscillator level and the envelope. Higher feedback creates a more complex resulting waveform.</p><p>Osc Phase (Phase) — This sets the initial phase of the oscillator. The range represents one whole cycle.</p><p>Retrigger (R) — When enabled, the oscillator restarts at the same position in its phase each time a note is triggered. With R disabled, the oscillator is free-running.</p><p>Repeat — Higher harmonics can be generated by repeating the drawn partials with a gradual fadeout, based on the settings in the Repeat chooser. Low Repeat values result in a brighter sound, while higher values result in more high-end roll-off and a more prominent fundamental. With Repeat off, partials above the 16th, 32nd or 64th harmonic are truncated.</p><p>Osc Frequency &lt; Velocity (Osc &lt; Vel) — The frequency of an oscillator can be modulated by note velocity. Positive values raise the oscillator’s pitch with greater velocities, and negative values lower it.</p><p>Osc Freq &lt; Vel Quantized (Q) — This allows quantizing the effect of the Frequency &lt; Velocity parameter.

For the filter and pitch envelopes, the shape of the segment can be adjusted.</p><p>Envelope Release Time (Release) — This is the time it takes for a note to reach the end level after a note-off message is received. For the oscillator envelopes, this level is always -inf dB and the shape of the segment is exponential. For the filter and pitch envelopes, the end level is determined by the End Level parameter and the shape of the segment can be adjusted. This envelope segment will begin at the value of the envelope at the moment the note-off message occurs, regardless of which segment is currently active.</p><p>Envelope Initial Level (Initial) — This sets the initial value of the envelope.</p><p>Envelope Peak Level (Peak) — This is the peak level at the end of the note attack.</p><p>Envelope Sustain Level (Sustain) — This is the sustain level at the end of the note decay.

If set to Beat or Sync, it will start again after a given beat-time. In Sync Mode, this behavior will be quantized to song time. In Trigger mode, the envelope ignores note off.</p><p>Envelope Beat/Sync Rate (Repeat) — The envelope will be retriggered after this amount of beat-time, as long as it is still on. When retriggered, the envelope will move at the given attack rate from the current level to the peak level.</p><p>Envelope Loop Time (Time) — If a note is still on after the end of the decay/sustain segment, the envelope will start again from its initial value.

This is especially interesting if the envelopes are looping. Note that this modulation does not influence the beat-time in Beat or Sync Modes, but the envelope segments themselves.</p><p>The filter and pitch envelopes also provide parameters that adjust the slope of their envelope segments.

It has been designed from the start to handle multi-gigabyte instrument libraries with ease, and it imports most common library formats. But with Sampler, playback is only the beginning; its extensive internal modulation system, which addresses nearly every aspect of its sound, makes it the natural extension of Live‘s sound-shaping techniques.</p><section id="getting-started-with-sampler" data-number="1.9.1"><h3 data-number="27.9.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.9.1</span> Getting Started with Sampler</h3><p>Getting started with Sampler is as easy as choosing a preset from the browser. Like all of Live‘s devices, Sampler’s presets are located in folders listed beneath its name. Presets imported from third-party sample libraries are listed here, too, in the <em>Imports</em> folder.</p><p>Once you have loaded a Sampler preset into a track, remember to arm the track for recording (which also enables you to hear any MIDI notes you might want to play), and then start playing!</p></section><section id="multisampling" data-number="1.9.2"><h3 data-number="27.9.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.9.2</span> Multisampling</h3><p>Before going on, let’s introduce the concept of <em>multisampling</em>. This technique is used to accurately capture the complexity of instruments that produce dynamic timbral changes. Rather than rely on the simple transposition of a single recorded sample, multisampling captures an instrument at multiple points within its critical sonic range. This typically means capturing the instrument at different pitches as well as different levels of emphasis (played softly, moderately, loudly, etc.). The resulting <em>multisample</em> is a collection of all the individually recorded sample files.</p><p>The acoustic piano, for example, is a commonly multisampled instrument. Because the piano’s pitch and dynamic ranges are very wide and timbrally complex, transposing one sample across many octaves would not reproduce the nuances of the instrument. Since multisampling relies on different sound sources, three or more samples per piano key could be made (soft, medium, loud, very loud, and so on), maximizing the sampler’s expressive possibilities.</p><p>Sampler is designed to let you approach multisampling on whatever level you like: you can load and play multisample presets, import multisamples from third-party vendors (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#importing-third-party-multisamples">‘Importing Third-Party Multisamples’</a>), or create your own multisamples from scratch. Lastly, you do not have use multisamples at all — drop a single sample into Sampler and take advantage of its internal modulation system however you like.</p></section><section id="title-bar-options" data-number="1.9.3"><h3 data-number="27.9.3"><span class="header-section-number">27.9.3</span> Title Bar Options</h3><p>Before delving into Sampler’s deep modulation features, let’s look at Sampler’s title bar context menu.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TitleBarContextMenu.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Sampler’s Title Bar Context Menu.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Cut, Copy, Rename, Edit Info Text, and Delete should already be familiar, the other options deserve some explanation.</p><p><em>Group</em> — Selecting this will load Sampler into a new Instrument Rack.</p><p><em>Fold</em> — Folds Sampler so that only the device title bar is visible.

Samples are only triggered when incoming MIDI notes lie within their key zone. Every sample has its own key zone, which can span anywhere from a single key up to the full 127.</p><p>A typical multisampled instrument contains many individual samples, distributed into many key zones. Samples are captured at a particular key of an instrument’s voice range (known as their <em>root key</em>), but may continue to sound accurate when transposed a few semitones up or down. This range usually corresponds to the sample’s key zone; ranges beyond this zone are represented by additional samples, as needed.</p><p>By default, the key zones of newly imported samples cover the full MIDI note range. Zones can be moved and resized like clips in the Arrangement View, by dragging their right or left edges to resize them, then dragging them into position.</p><p>Zones can also be faded over a number of semitones at either end by dragging their top right or left corners.

The filter section offers a variety of filter types including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, and a special Morph filter. Each filter can be switched between 12 and 24 dB slopes as well as a selection of analog-modeled circuit behaviors developed in conjunction with Cytomic that emulate hardware filters found on some classic analog synthesizers.</p><p>The Clean circuit option is a high-quality, CPU-efficient design that is the same as the filters used in EQ Eight (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#eq-eight">‘EQ Eight’</a>).

It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point.</p><p>When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter.</p><p>The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.</p><p>Tip: you can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via dedicated options in the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu of the Morph slider.</p><p>To the right, the filter’s cutoff frequency can be modulated over time by a dedicated filter envelope. This envelope works similarly to the envelopes in the Pitch/Osc tab, with Initial, Peak, Sustain and End levels, ADSR, Loop mode and slope points. This area is toggled on/off with the F. Env button. The Amount slider determines how much influence the filter envelope has on the filter’s cutoff frequency, and needs to be set to a non-zero value for the envelope to have any effect.</p><p>Below the Filter is a waveshaper, which is toggled by clicking the Shaper button. Four different curves can be chosen for the waveshaper in the Type selector: Soft, Hard, Sine and 4bit. Shaper’s overall intensity can be controlled with the Amount slider.

A Simpler voice plays a user-defined region of a sample, which is in turn processed by envelope, filter, LFO, volume and pitch components. But unlike a conventional sampler, Simpler includes some unique functionality inherited from Live’s clips. Specifically, Simpler can play back samples using Live’s warping. Warped samples will play back at the tempo of your Set, regardless of which note you play. Warping in Simpler works in much the same way as it does in audio clips, and bringing a warped clip into Simpler from an audio track, the browser, or your desktop preserves your manual warp settings. For more information about warping, see the Audio Clips, Tempo, and Warping chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#audio-clips-tempo-and-warping">‘Audio Clips, Tempo, and Warping’</a>).</p><p>Simpler’s interface is divided into two sections: the Sample and Controls tabs.

Samples can be dragged into Simpler either directly from the browser, or from the Session or Arrangement View in the form of clips. In the latter case, Simpler will use only the section of the sample demarcated by the clip’s start/end or loop markers.

It features a complete ADSR envelope and supports looping, allowing for samples to sustain as long as a note is held down. Classic Mode is polyphonic by default.</li><li><em>One-Shot Playback Mode</em> is exclusively for monophonic playback, and is optimized for use with one-shot drum hits or short sampled phrases. This mode has simplified envelope controls and does not support looping. By default, the entire sample will play back when a note is triggered, regardless of how long the note is held.</li><li><em>Slicing Playback Mode</em> non-destructively slices the sample so that the individual slices can be played back chromatically. You can create and move slices manually, or choose from a number of different options for how Simpler will automatically create slices. This mode is ideal for working with rhythmic drum breaks.</li></ul><section id="classic-playback-mode" data-number="1.10.1.1"><h4 data-number="27.10.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.10.1.1</span> Classic Playback Mode</h4><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SimplerClassicMode.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Sample Tab in Classic Playback Mode.</figcaption></figure><p>In Classic Playback Mode, the various sample position controls change which region of the sample you play back. These controls include the Start and Length parameters as well as the two “flags” that appear in the waveform display. The left flag sets the absolute position in the sample from which playback can start, while the End control sets where playback can end. Start and Length are then represented in percentages of the total sample length enabled by the flags. For example, a Length value of 50% will play exactly half of the region between the flags. The Loop slider determines how much of the available sample will loop. This parameter is only active if the Loop switch is enabled.</p><p>(Note: it’s possible to create sustaining loops that are so short they take on a glitchy or granular character, or even take on a pitch as a result of looping at audio rates. While this might be exactly the effect you want, it can cause very high CPU loads, particularly when working with the Complex or Complex Pro warp modes.)</p><p>Quite often, you’ll start with a longer region of a sample and end up using only a small part of it. Simpler’s waveform display can be zoomed and panned just as in other parts of Live — drag vertically or scroll with the mousewheel or trackpad while holding the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac) modifier to zoom, and drag horizontally to pan different areas of the sample into view. Zooming works the same in all three playback modes.</p><p>Pressing the Loop On/Off button determines whether or not the sample will loop when a note is held down. It is possible for glitches or pops to occur between a looped sample’s start and end points due to the discontinuity in waveform amplitude (i.e., the sample’s loudness). The Snap switch will help mitigate these by forcing Simpler’s loop and region markers to snap to <em>zero-crossing</em> points in the sample (points where the amplitude is zero). Note: Snapping is based on the left channel of stereo samples. It is therefore still possible, even with Snap activated, to encounter glitches with stereo samples.</p><p>The transition from loop end to loop start can be smoothed with the Fade control, which crossfades the two points. This method is especially useful when working with long, textural samples.</p><p>The Gain slider allows you to boost or cut the level of the sample. Note that this is a separate gain stage from Simpler’s Volume knob, which determines the final output level of the entire instrument (after processing through Simpler’s filter). This parameter is available in all three playback modes.</p><p>The Voices parameter sets the maximum number of voices that Simpler can play simultaneously. If more voices are needed than have been allocated by the Voices chooser, “voice stealing“ will take place, in which the oldest voice(s) will be dropped in favor of those that are new. For example, if your Voices parameter is set to 8, and ten voices are all vying to be played, the two oldest voices will be dropped. (Simpler does try to make voice stealing as subtle as possible.)</p><p>With Retrig enabled, a note that is already sustaining will be cut off if the same note is played again. If Retrig is disabled, multiple copies of the same note can overlap. Note that Retrig only has an audible effect if the sample has a long release time and the number of Voices is set to more than one.</p><p>The various warp parameters are the same in all three playback modes and are discussed below (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#warp-controls">‘Warp Controls’</a>).</p></section><section id="one-shot-playback-mode" data-number="1.10.1.2"><h4 data-number="27.10.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.10.1.2</span> One-Shot Playback Mode</h4><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SimplerOneShotMode.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Sample Tab in One-Shot Playback Mode.</figcaption></figure><p>In One-Shot Playback Mode, the left and right flags set the available playback region, as they do in Classic Mode, but there are no Loop or Length controls.

The Sensitivity slider determines how sensitive Simpler is to transient levels within the sample, and thus how many slices will be automatically created. Higher numbers result in more slices, up to a maximum of 64 slices.</li><li><em>Beat</em> - Slices are placed at musical beat divisions. The Division chooser selects the beat division at which Simpler will slice the sample region.</li><li><em>Region</em> - Slices are placed at equal time divisions. The Regions chooser selects the number of evenly-spaced slices that will be created.</li><li><em>Manual</em> - Slices are created manually, by double-clicking within the sample region. When Manual is selected, no slices are placed automatically.</li></ul><p>The Playback chooser determines how many slices can be triggered simultaneously. Mono is monophonic; only one slice can be played at a time. When set to Poly, multiple slices can be triggered together. The Voices and Retrig controls are available with Poly enabled, and work as they do in Classic Playback Mode. When set to Thru, playback is monophonic, but triggering one slice will continue playback through the rest of the sample region.</p><p>The Trigger/Gate switch works the same as it does in One-Shot Playback Mode. The Fade In and Out controls behave slightly differently, depending on the setting of the Playback chooser. With Mono or Poly selected, the Fade times are measured from the beginning to the end of each individual slice, while with Thru selected, they are measured from the triggered slice to the end of the region. This means that the fade times may sound different depending on where in the region you trigger.</p><p>Automatically created slices appear as vertical blue lines on the waveform display. Double-clicking a slice deletes it. If you’re not satisfied with Simpler’s automatic slice placement, you can click and drag a slice to move it to a new position. Double-clicking on the waveform between slices will create manual slices, which appear white. In Transients mode, holding <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>ALT</kbd>(Mac) and clicking on a slice will toggle it between a manual and automatic slice. Manually created slices in Transients mode are preserved regardless of the Sensitivity amount.</p></section></section><section id="warp-controls" data-number="1.10.2"><h3 data-number="27.10.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.10.2</span> Warp Controls</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SimplerWarpParameters.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Simpler’s Warp Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>When the Warp switch is off, Simpler behaves like a “conventional” sampler; as you play back the sample at different pitches, the sample plays back at different speeds. In some cases, this is exactly the effect that you want. But when working with samples that have their own inherent rhythm, you may want to enable Warp. This will cause Simpler to play back the sample in sync with your current song tempo, regardless of which notes you play.</p><p>If you’re familiar with how warping works in audio clips, you’ll find that Simpler’s Warp Modes and settings behave in the same way.

It is modeled on the filters used in a famous semi-modular Japanese monosynth and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The SMP circuit is a custom design not based on any particular hardware. It shares characteristics of both the MS2 and PRD circuits and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The PRD circuit uses a ladder design and has no explicit resonance limiting. It is modeled on the filters used in a legacy dual-oscillator monosynth from the United States and is available for the low-pass and high-pass filters.</p><p>The most important filter parameters are the typical synth controls Frequency and Resonance. Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point.</p><p>When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter.</p><p>The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.</p><p>Tip: you can quickly snap the Morph control to a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, or notch setting via dedicated options in the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu of the Morph knob.</p><p>The Frequency and Envelope buttons in the filter section’s display area toggle between showing the filter’s frequency response and its envelope.

Amplitude, filter frequency, and pitch modulation are all modifiable by toggling their respective buttons in the envelope section. Attack controls the time in milliseconds that it takes for the envelope to reach its peak value after a note is played. Decay controls the amount of time it takes for the envelope to drop down to the Sustain level, which is held until the note is released. Release time is the amount of time after the end of the note that it takes for the envelope to drop from the Sustain level back down to zero. These parameters can be adjusted via their dedicated controls or graphically, by dragging the handles within the envelope visualizations.</p><p>The influence of envelopes on pitch and filter cutoff can be set using the envelope amount (Amount) controls in the top right of each of these sections.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SimplerPitchEnvAmount.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Pitch Envelope Amount Control.</figcaption></figure><p>The Amplitude Envelope can be looped via the Loop chooser.

LFOs are applied individually to each <em>voice</em>, or played note, in Simpler.</p><p>The time required for the LFO to reach full intensity is determined by the Attack control. The R switch toggles Retrigger. When enabled, the LFO’s phase is reset to the Offset value for each new note. (Note that Offset has no effect when Retrigger is disabled.)</p><p>The Key parameter scales each LFO’s Rate in proportion to the pitch of incoming notes. A high Key setting assigns higher notes a higher LFO rate.

The two voices are detuned, and the amount of detuning can be adjusted with the Spread control.</p><p><em>Tip</em>: Whether or not spread is applied to a particular note depends upon the setting of the Spread parameter during the note-on event. To achieve special effects, you could, for instance, create a sequence where Spread is zero most of the time and turned on only for some notes. These notes will then play in stereo, while the others will play mono.</p><p>The output volume of Simpler is controlled by the Volume control, which can also be dependent upon note velocity, as adjusted by the Velocity &gt; Volume control. Tremolo effects can be achieved by allowing the LFO to modulate the Volume parameter.</p><p>Simpler plays back a sample at its original pitch if the incoming MIDI note is C3, however the Transpose control allows transposing this by +/- 48 semitones. Pitch can also be modulated by the LFO or pitch envelope. The pitch envelope is especially helpful in creating percussive sounds. Simpler reacts to MIDI Pitch Bend messages with a sensitivity of +/- 5 semitones. You can also modulate the Transpose parameter with clip envelopes and external controllers. For fine tuning of the pitch, use the Detune control, which can be adjusted +/- 50 cents.</p><p>Simpler includes a glide function. When this function is activated, new notes will start from the pitch of the last note played and then slide gradually to their own pitch. Two glide modes are available: Glide, which works monophonically, and Portamento, which works polyphonically. The speed of the glide is set with the Time control.</p></section><section id="context-menu-options" data-number="1.10.7"><h3 data-number="27.10.7"><span class="header-section-number">27.10.7</span> Context Menu Options</h3><p>A number of Simpler’s features are only accessible by opening the context menu via a <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) on the sample display or Simpler’s title bar.</p><p>By default, Simpler uses constant-power fades.

Slice to New MIDI Track is similar, but this creates an additional track containing a Drum Rack rather than replacing the current Simpler. Additionally, when slicing to a new track, a clip is created that plays back the slices in order.

The synthesizer is entirely based on physical modeling technology and uses no sampling or wavetables. Instead, it produces sound by solving mathematical equations that model the different components in string instruments and how they interact. This elaborate synthesis engine responds dynamically to the control signals it receives while you play thereby reproducing the richness and responsiveness of real string instruments.</p><p>Tension features four types of exciters (two types of hammer, a pick and a bow), an accurate model of a string, a model of the fret/finger interaction, a damper model and different types of soundboards. The combination of these different elements allows for the reproduction of a wide range of string instruments. Tension is also equipped with filters, LFOs, envelope parameters, and MPE support, which extend the sound sculpting possibilities beyond what would be possible with “real-world“ instruments. Finally, Tension offers a wide range of performance features, including keyboard modes, portamento, vibrato, and legato functions.</p><section id="architecture-and-interface-3" data-number="1.11.1"><h3 data-number="27.11.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.11.1</span> Architecture and Interface</h3><p>It is the vibration from the <em>string</em> which constitutes the main sound production mechanism of the instrument. The string is set into motion by the action of an <em>exciter</em> which can be a hammer, a pick or a bow. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the effective length of the string, which is controlled by the finger/fret interaction or <em>termination</em>. A <em>damper</em> can be applied to the strings in order to reduce the decay time of the oscillation. This is the case on a piano, for example, when felt is applied to the strings by releasing the keys and sustain pedal. The vibration from the string is then transmitted to the <em>body</em> of the instrument, which can radiate sound efficiently. In some instruments, the string vibration is transmitted directly to the body through the bridge. In other instruments, such as the electric guitar, a <em>pickup</em> is used to transmit the string vibration to an amplifier. In addition to these main sections, a <em>filter</em> section has been included between the string and body sections in order to expand the sonic possibilities of the instrument.</p><p>The Tension interface is divided into two main tabs, which are further divided into sections. The <em>String</em> tab contains all of the fundamental sound producing components related to the string itself: <em>Exciter, Damper, String, Vibrato, Termination, Pickup,</em> and <em>Body</em>. The <em>Filter/Global</em> tab contains the Filter section and the MPE section, as well as controls for global performance parameters. Each section (with the exception of String and the global Keyboard section) can be enabled or disabled independently. Turning off a section reduces CPU usage.</p></section><section id="string-tab" data-number="1.11.2"><h3 data-number="27.11.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.11.2</span> String Tab</h3><p>The String tab contains the parameters related to the physical properties of the string itself, as well as the way in which it’s played.</p><section id="the-exciter-section" data-number="1.11.2.1"><h4 data-number="27.11.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">27.11.2.1</span> The Exciter Section</h4><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TensionExcitatorSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tension’s Exciter Section.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="exciter-types" data-number="1.11.2.2"><h4 data-number="27.11.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.11.2.2</span> Exciter Types</h4><p>The modeled string can be played using different types of exciters in order to reproduce different types of instruments and playing techniques.</p><p>The Exciter section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name. With it off, the string can only be activated by interaction with its damper. If both the Exciter and Damper sections are deactivated, nothing can set the string in motion — if you find that you’re not producing any sound, check to see that at least one of these sections is on.</p><p>The Exciter Type chooser offers four choices - <em>Bow, Hammer, Hammer (bouncing)</em> and <em>Plectrum</em>.</p><p><em>Bow</em> — this exciter is associated with bowed instruments such as the violin, viola or cello. The bow sets the string in sustained oscillation. The motion of the bow hair across the string creates friction, causing the string to alternate between sticking to the hair and breaking free. The frequency of this alternation between sticking and slipping determines the fundamental pitch. Note that the Damping knob is unavailable when the Bow exciter is selected.</p><p><em>Hammer</em> — this exciter type simulates the behavior of soft hammers or mallets. Hammer models a hammer that is located below the string and strikes it once before falling away. This type of mechanism is found in a piano, for example.</p><p><em>Hammer (bouncing)</em> - this exciter type is similar to <em>Hammer</em>, except that it models a hammer that is located above the string and is dropped onto it, meaning that it can bounce on the string multiple times. This playing mode can be found on a hammered dulcimer, for example.</p><p><em>Plectrum</em> — a plectrum or “pick“ is associated with instruments such as guitars and harpsichords. It can be thought of as an angled object placed under the string that snaps the string into motion.</p></section><section id="exciter-parameters" data-number="1.11.2.3"><h4 data-number="27.11.2.3"><span class="header-section-number">27.11.2.3</span> Exciter Parameters</h4><p>Next to the Exciter Type chooser are five parameter knobs. The first two parameters vary depending on the chosen Exciter Type, whereas the last three parameters are universal.</p><p><em>Bow Parameters:</em></p><ul><li>The Force knob adjusts the amount of pressure being applied to the string by the bow. The sound becomes more “scratchy“ as you increase this value.</li><li>The Friction knob adjusts the amount of friction between the bow and the string. Higher values usually result in a faster attack.</li></ul><p><em>Hammer / Hammer (bouncing) Parameters:</em></p><ul><li>The Mass knob adjusts the mass of the hammer.</li><li>The Stiffness knob adjusts the stiffness of the hammer’s surface area.</li></ul><p><em>Plectrum Parameters:</em></p><ul><li>The Protrusion knob adjusts how much of the plectrum’s surface area is placed under the string.

At 0%, the exciter contacts the string at its termination point, while at 50% it activates the string at its midpoint. When the Fix. Pos switch (described in more detail below) is enabled, however, the position is not dependent on the length of the string.</li><li>The Damping knob adjusts how much of the exciter’s impact force is absorbed back into the exciter. (Note - For the <em>Hammer (bouncing)</em> exciter, this is somewhat analogous to the Stiffness parameter, but instead of controlling the stiffness of the hammer’s surface it adjusts the stiffness of the virtual “spring“ that connects the hammer to the mass that powers it. As you increase the Damping amount, the interaction between the hammer and string will become shorter, generally resulting in a louder, brighter sound.)</li></ul><p>The Fix. Pos switch fixes the contact point to a single location, rather than changing as the length of the string changes. This behavior is similar to that of a guitar, where the picking position is always basically the same regardless of the notes being played. On a piano, the exciter position is relative — the hammers normally strike the string at about 1/7th of their length — and so is best modeled with Fix. Pos turned off.</p><p>Finally, the Vel and Key sliders below these three controls allow you to modulate their behavior based on note velocity or pitch, respectively.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TensionExciterKeySliders.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tension’s Exciter Velocity and Key Modulation.</figcaption></figure><p>Please note that the Exciter section’s parameters work closely together to influence the overall behavior of the instrument.

In pianos, this is a felt pad that is applied to the string when the key is released. In instruments such as guitars and violins, the player damps by stopping the string’s vibration with their fingers. Dampers regulate the decay of strings but also produce some sound of their own, which is an important characteristic of a string instrument’s timbre. The Damper section can be toggled on or off via the switch next to its name.</p><p>Although a damper functions to mute the string rather than activate it, it is somewhat analogous to a hammer, and shares some of the same parameters.</p><p>The Mass knob controls how hard the damper’s surface will press against the string. As you increase the value, the string will mute more quickly.</p><p>The stiffness of the damper’s material is adjusted with the Stiffness control. Lower values simulate soft materials such as felt, while higher values model a metal damper.</p><p>Note that very high Mass and Stiffness values can simulate dampers that connect with the string hard enough to change its effective length, thus causing a change in tuning.</p><p>The Velocity control adjusts the speed with which the damper is applied to the string when the key is released, as well as the speed with which it is lifted from the string when the key is depressed. Be careful with this parameter — very high Velocity values can cause the damper to hit the string extremely hard, which can result in a very loud sound on key release. Note that the state of the Gated switch determines whether or not the Velocity control is enabled. When the Gated switch is turned on, the damper is applied to the string when the key is released. With Gated off, the damper always remains on the string, which means that the Velocity control has no effect.</p><p>The Position knob serves an analogous function to the control in the Exciter section, but here specifies the point on the string where the damper makes contact. At 0%, the damper contacts the string at its termination point, while at 50% it damps the string at its midpoint. The behavior is a bit different if the Fix. Pos switch is enabled, however. In this case, the contact point is fixed to a single location, rather than changing as the length of the string changes.</p><p>The Mass, Stiffness and Velocity, and Position parameters can be further modulated by note pitch using the Key sliders below them.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TensionDamperKeySliders.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tension’s Damper Velocity and Key Modulation.</figcaption></figure><p>The stiffness of the damper mechanism is adjusted with the Damping knob, which affects the overall amount of vibration absorbed by the damper. Lower values result in less damping (longer decay times.) But this becomes a bit less predictable as the Damping value goes over 50%. At higher values, the mechanism becomes so stiff that it bounces against the string. This in turn reduces the overall amount of time that the damper is in contact with the string, causing an increase in decay time. The best way to get a sense of how this parameter behaves is to gradually turn up the knob as you repeatedly strike a single key.</p><p>The String Section</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TensionStringSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tension’s String Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The vibration of the string is the main component of a stringed instrument’s sound. The effective length of the string is also responsible for the pitch of the sound we hear.</p><p>The Decay slider determines how long it takes for the resonating string to decay to silence. Higher values increase the decay time. The &lt; Key slider next to Decay allows decay time to be modulated by note pitch.</p><p>The Ratio slider sets the ratio of the decay time of the string’s oscillation during note onset and release. At 0%, the time set by the Decay slider sets the decay time for both the onset and release of the note. As you increase the Ratio, the release time decreases but the onset decay time stays the same.</p><p>The theoretical model of a resonating string is harmonic, meaning that the string’s partials are all exact multiples of the fundamental frequency. Real-world strings, however, are all more or less inharmonic, and this increases with the width of the string. The Inharm slider models this behavior, causing upper partials to become increasingly out of tune as its value increases.</p><p>The Damping slider adjusts the amount of high frequency content in the string’s vibration. Higher values result in more upper partials (less damping). This parameter can be modulated by note pitch via the &lt; Key slider to its right.</p><p>The Vibrato Section</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TensionVibratoSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tension’s Vibrato Section</figcaption></figure><p>The Vibrato section uses an LFO to modulate the string’s pitch.

Rate adjusts the frequency of the pitch variation, while Amount adjusts the intensity (amplitude) of the effect.</p><p>The &lt; Mod slider adjusts how much the modulation wheel will affect the vibrato intensity.

At 0%, the pickup is located at the string’s termination point, while at 50% it is under the midpoint of the string. Lower values generally result in a brighter, thinner sound, while higher values have more fullness and depth.</p><p>The Body Section</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TensionBodySection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tension’s Body Section.</figcaption></figure><p>The role of the body or soundboard of a string instrument is to radiate the vibration energy from the strings.

At 0%, Tension will play in equal temperament, which means that two notes are an octave apart when the upper note’s fundamental pitch is exactly twice the lower note’s. But because the actual resonance behavior of a vibrating tine or string differs from the theoretical model, equal temperament tends to sound “wrong“ on pianos. Increasing the Stretch amount raises the pitch of upper notes while lowering the pitch of lower ones. The result is a more brilliant sound.

But it’s important to remember that Tension’s components are not isolated from one another; what you do to one parameter can have a dramatic effect on a parameter somewhere else. Because of this, it’s very easy to find parameter combinations that produce no sound at all. It’s also very easy to create extremely loud sounds, so be careful when setting levels!</p><p>When using Tension, it may help to think about the various sections as if they really are attached to a single, physical object. For example, a bow moving at a slow speed could perhaps excite an undamped string. But if that string is constricted by an enormous damper, the bow will need to increase its velocity to have any effect.</p><p>To get a sense of what’s possible, it may help to study how the presets were made.

It’s designed to be usable by musicians and sound designers with any amount of synthesis experience; it’s simple enough to yield great results with a minimum of effort but offers a nearly limitless range of possibilities as you go deeper.</p><p>Wavetable’s interface is divided into three main sections: the oscillators (which each have their own tab), the two filters, and the modulation section (which is divided between three tabs). To see more parameters in a single view, click the <span class="inline-image"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Device_unfold.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=24"></span> button in Wavetable’s title bar.

A wavetable is simply an arbitrary collection of short, looping samples that are arranged together. Playing a note with the oscillator fixed to just one of these samples will produce a steady tone with a consistent timbre. But the real power of wavetable synthesis comes by moving between the various samples in the table as the note plays, which results in a shifting timbre. Wavetable synthesis is extremely well-suited for producing dynamic sounds that change over time.</p></section><section id="oscillators-2" data-number="1.12.2"><h3 data-number="27.12.2"><span class="header-section-number">27.12.2</span> Oscillators</h3><p>Wavetable’s oscillators have been optimized for maximum sound quality. As long as no modulation is applied, the raw output of the oscillators is perfectly band-limited and will not produce aliasing artifacts at any pitch.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/WavetableOscillators.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Wavetable’s Oscillators.</figcaption></figure><p>Each oscillator can be turned on or off independently via a switch in the oscillator’s tab. Clicking a tab will select that oscillator, revealing its parameters for editing.</p><p>The overall output level of each oscillator is adjusted with its Gain slider, while its position in the stereo field can be adjusted with the Pan control. The coarse and fine tuning of each oscillator can be set with the Semi and Detune controls. Note that this tuning is in relation to the global Transposition slider.</p><p>Select a wavetable using the choosers or the arrow buttons. The first chooser selects a category of wavetable, while the second chooser selects a specific wavetable from within that category. The arrow buttons will automatically switch to the next category when you reach the end of the current one, so you can continuously move through the wavetables using the arrows alone.</p><p>You can extend the sonic capabilities of Wavetable’s oscillator section by loading any WAV or AIFF file as a wavetable. To do this, drag and drop a sample from the browser directly onto the wavetable visualization. The choosers and arrow buttons will now reference the folder containing the imported sample, allowing you to quickly audition any other samples in that folder.</p><p>Wavetable will automatically process imported samples to reduce unwanted artefacts. Note that you can bypass this processing by activating the Raw mode switch. Raw mode is especially useful when loading files that have been prepared specifically for use as a wavetable. However, it can also be “misused” to create unpredictable, noisy or glitchy sounds.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/WavetableOscillatorsRawSwitch.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Wavetable’s Raw Mode Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>The oscillator’s wavetable is visualized in the center of the oscillator tab. Clicking and dragging within the visualization will move to a different position within the wavetable. You can also change the wavetable position via the Wave Position slider.</p><p>There are two types of wavetable visualizations available, and these can be switched via the wavetable visualization switch. Both views represent the same information, but visualized in different ways. The linear view arranges the waveforms from bottom to top, with time running from left to right. The polar view displays the waveforms as loops from inside to outside, with time running clockwise.</p><p>Although there is a huge range of available wavetables, it’s also possible to transform the sound of each wavetable itself through the use of oscillator effects. Select from three effects in the chooser and then adjust the parameters for those effects via the sliders to the right. The oscillator effects include:</p><ul><li>FM — applies frequency modulation to the oscillator. The Amt slider adjusts the intensity of the frequency modulation, while the Tune slider determines the frequency of the modulation oscillator. With a tuning of 50% (and -50%), the modulation oscillator is one octave higher (or lower) than the main oscillator. At 100% (and -100%), the modulation oscillator is two octaves higher (or lower). In between these values, the modulation oscillator is at inharmonic ratios, which is ideal for creating noisy overtones.</li><li>Classic — provides two modulation types that are common from classic analog synthesizers. PW adjusts the pulse width of the waveform (Note that in hardware synthesizers, it is normally only possible to adjust the pulse width of square waves. In Wavetable, the pulse width can be adjusted for all wavetables.) Sync applies a “hidden” oscillator that resets the phase of the audible oscillator, altering its timbre.</li><li>Modern — provides two additional options for distorting the shape of the waveform. Warp is similar to pulse width, while Fold applies wavefolding distortion.</li></ul><p>Note that the values of the two effects parameters don’t change when the effect type changes. This makes it possible to move between the effects to experiment with how the different processes affect the timbre with the same values.</p></section><section id="sub-oscillator" data-number="1.12.3"><h3 data-number="27.12.3"><span class="header-section-number">27.12.3</span> Sub Oscillator</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/WavetableSubOscillator.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Wavetable’s Sub Oscillator.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the two main oscillators, Wavetable includes a sub oscillator.

Frequency determines where in the harmonic spectrum the filter is applied; Resonance boosts frequencies near that point. Note that you can adjust the Frequency and Resonance parameters by clicking and dragging either of the filter dots in the filter display.</p><p>When using the low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter with any circuit type besides Clean, there is an additional Drive control that can be used to add gain or distortion to the signal before it enters the filter.</p><p>The Morph filter has an additional Morph control which sweeps the filter type continuously from low-pass to band-pass to high-pass to notch and back to low-pass.</p><p>Filter routing allows you to arrange the filters in various configurations for drastically different sculpting techniques. You can choose from one of three different routings:</p><ul><li>Serial — routes all oscillators into Filter 1, and routes Filter 1 into Filter 2. Sub is routed to both filters.</li><li>Parallel — routes the two main oscillators into Filter 1 and Filter 2. Sub is routed to both filters.</li><li>Split — routes Oscillator 1 to Filter 1, and Oscillator 2 to Filter 2. Sub is split in half and sent to both filters. If either filter is off, the corresponding oscillator’s signal is still audible. Split can be used to treat each filter separately, and is useful for cases where you want to create layered synth sounds. If the main oscillators are disabled while both filters are engaged, Split can also be used to add extra treatment to the Sub oscillator.</li></ul></section><section id="matrix-tab-1" data-number="1.12.5"><h3 data-number="27.12.5"><span class="header-section-number">27.12.5</span> Matrix Tab</h3><p>The Modulation Matrix enables assigning modulation from Envelopes and LFOs (also known as “internal modulation sources”) to parameters within the instrument (or “modulation targets”).</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/WavetableMatrixTab.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Wavetable’s Matrix Tab.</figcaption></figure><p>The modulation sources run horizontally, while the modulation targets run vertically.

This version of Expression Control is a new take on the Max for Live device of the same name, with expanded functionality and a redesigned user interface centered around a visual display of the device’s modulation curves.</p><p>The previous version of this device is still available and has been renamed <a href="/en/live-manual/12/max-for-live-devices/#expression-control-legacy">Expression Control Legacy</a>. Live Sets made in Live 11 that contain Expression Control will load the Expression Control Legacy device automatically.</p><p>Expression Control has five Mod Source Tabs that can be used to set a MIDI or MPE expression parameter as a modulation source. A MIDI Input Source drop-down menu in each tab lets you choose between ten expression parameters: Velocity, Modwheel, Pitchbend, Pressure, Keytrack, Expression, Random, Increment, Slide, and Sustain.</p><p>Clicking on the Map to Target button links the selected modulation source to whichever parameter in Live that’s clicked on next.</p><p>The controls in the Output Range section depend on the Modulation toggle at the top right of the device. This toggle sets how Expression Control’s modulation values are generated, and has two modes: Modulate or Remote Control.</p><p>When Modulate is selected, base values of a mapped parameter can be adjusted using your cursor. In this mode, the value set or automated by Expression Control will be merged with the value being set as you tweak the parameter in question. When Remote Control is selected, modulated parameter values are set by Expression Control and interaction with base parameter values is no longer possible.</p><p>The Modulation toggle also affects Expression Control’s polarity modes. When Modulate is selected, a Modulation Polarity toggle in the Output Range section lets you choose between bipolar and unipolar modes. In Bipolar mode, modulation is centered around the base parameter value being modulated. In Unipolar mode, modulation is added to the base parameter value being modulated. The Output Range Max slider sets the output modulation value generated when the input signal is at its maximum amplitude. When Remote Control is selected, the Output Range section lets you set minimum and maximum output modulation values using the Output Range Min and Output Range Max sliders.</p><p>The Curve Type buttons below the Curve Display can be used to select a linear or S-shaped curve. The type of curve selected determines which controls are available in the Curve section.</p><p>When a linear curve (with two breakpoints) is selected, the Curve A dial adjusts the modulation curve’s entire shape. When an S-shaped curve (with three breakpoints) is selected, the Curve A dial adjusts the curve’s upper segment shape and the Curve B dial adjusts its lower segment shape. When the Curve Link button is enabled, the curve’s upper and lower segments can be inversely adjusted using only the Curve A dial.</p><p>The Curve Display provides a visualization of the modulation curve being generated by the device. Minimum and maximum values for the curve can be set via the Min/Max sliders. When an S-shaped curve is selected, the middle breakpoint’s horizontal and vertical positions can be set via the X-Y sliders. Breakpoints and curve shape can also be adjusted by clicking and dragging the visualized curve directly in the display.</p><p>When Increment is selected as a modulation source in any MIDI Input Source drop-down menu, the Increment Steps slider is activated. This value defines how many note triggers are necessary to cycle through the device’s entire modulation range, and can be set to a value from 1 to 32 steps. Stopping transport will reset the count, so that the first note played when transport restarts will output the minimum modulation value that has been set.</p><p>When Random is selected as a modulation source in any MIDI Input Source drop-down menu, the Random Amount slider is activated. This slider sets how much random deviation is applied to the target modulation value with each note trigger.</p><p>The Smoothing Type toggle lets you choose between linear or logarithmic smoothing between modulation values.</p><p>The Smoothing Rise and Fall sliders set the amount of time it takes for increasing and decreasing modulation values to reach the most recent value, from 0 to 1000 milliseconds.</p></section><section id="expression-control-legacy" data-number="1.3.3"><h3 data-number="29.3.3"><span class="header-section-number">29.3.3</span> Expression Control Legacy</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MaxExpressionControl.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Expression Control Legacy Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Expression Control Legacy effect is not available in the Lite, Intro or Standard Editions unless you have Live Standard with a Max for Live license.)</p><p>Expression Control Legacy is a parameter modulation device that allows for a wide variety of internal MIDI mappings.

It is typically used in conjunction with another device to fine-tune the effect MPE data has on mapped parameters. MPE Control also allows converting MPE signals to global MIDI, making it possible to use an MPE controller with non-MPE enabled instruments.</p><p>Before we get into the details of how you can use the MPE Control effect to shape the incoming MPE data, let’s have a look at the difference between MPE and standard MIDI messages. MPE enables MIDI Control Change (or MIDI CC) messages to be sent on a per-note basis, thus allowing you to articulate each note individually. Without MPE, those messages are sent globally, meaning that all notes are affected by the MIDI CC being used. For more detailed information on MPE check out the <a href="/en/live-manual/12/editing-mpe/#editing-mpe">‘Editing MPE’</a> chapter.</p><p>While MPE already allows a lot more musical expression than standard MIDI data, MPE Control gives you the ability to shape the MPE signals to a greater extent using curves, making it possible to play even more expressively. Let’s say you are using the Expression Control device and mapped its Slide MIDI input to the Filter Freq knob in Operator. Any incoming MPE slide data will affect the filter frequency. You can then use MPE Control to fine-tune the signal further, so that only very high slide values will reach a high frequency cutoff.</p><p>In MPE Control, the incoming MPE signals can be transformed via two types of curves that can be smoothed for consistent rise and fall times. There are three signal sources available: Press (pressure), Slide, as well as NotePB (per-note pitch bend), and each can be adjusted individually.</p><p>The curve of the selected MPE source is shown in the foreground of the display, making that curve and its respective controls available for editing. By default, all MPE sources are switched on, but they can be deactivated separately by clicking on the toggles next to their names.</p><p>For each MPE source, you can choose between two types of curve settings in the bottom left corner of the display: linear or S-shaped. The linear curve has two breakpoints, while the S-shaped curve has three breakpoints.</p><p>Choosing the linear setting lets you adjust the curve in two ways. You can use either the Curve control knob or click and drag the curve directly in the display. In addition to adjusting the curve, you can also modify the minimum and maximum values using the Min and Max sliders, or by dragging the breakpoints at the ends of the curve.</p><p>The linear setting provides one curve, creating a smooth ramp for the chosen modulation source, either “compressing” the data, making it easier to stay in the lower range of values, or “expanding” it, making it easier to reach higher values with less input.</p><p>When choosing the S-shaped curve, a third breakpoint is added to the middle of the curve’s line, separating the curve into two distinct segments. This breakpoint is movable, allowing complete control over the crossover point between the two segments, giving you the possibility to create much more radical curves. The two segments are linked together by default. Toggling the Curve Link button separates the segments from each other, so that they can be individually compressed or expanded using the two independent Curve dials.</p><p>Note that the position of the breakpoint separating the two segments can be adjusted either by directly clicking and dragging the breakpoint, or by using the X-Y controls at the bottom of the display. The X-Y controls are only active when using the S-shaped curve.</p><p>Clicking on the triangular button in the bottom right of the visualization will unfold the advanced settings panel.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MaxMPEControlExpandedView.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>MPE Control’s Expanded View.</figcaption></figure><p>All of the three modulation sources include the Smooth toggle which enables smoothing for the currently selected source.

You can also choose to send the MPE pressure data to the Slide instead of the Press source by using the Swap to Slide toggle. This is useful when, for example, you want to adjust the modulation via the vertical axis, but are using a controller which only supports polyphonic aftertouch.</p><p>The Press to AT setting converts the MPE pressure data to monophonic aftertouch, so that non-MPE instruments can be modulated via an MPE controller.</p></section><section id="slide" data-number="1.3.5.2"><h4 data-number="29.3.5.2"><span class="header-section-number">29.3.5.2</span> Slide</h4><p>The Slide source modifies MPE slide data (transmitted as MIDI CC 74), which corresponds to the vertical position of the finger on the controller key or pad.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MaxMPEControlSlideAdvanced.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Slide Advanced Settings.</figcaption></figure><p>Slide also includes a Default toggle for use with non-MPE data, as well as a Centered switch which is useful when playing pad-based MPE controllers. When Centered is switched on, MPE slide data is transformed so that hitting the center of the pad generates a modulation value of zero, and the modulation value increases progressively as the finger slides away from the center alongside the vertical axis.</p><p>By default, Slide is set to Abs mode, which means that MPE slide values are interpreted as absolute. Switching the mode to Rel (relative) will set the slide values to start in the middle of the range, regardless of where the finger is on the key. They can then only be modified by further sweeping the finger up and down while holding a note. In the Ons (onset) mode, MPE slide values will only be updated on Note On. Note that onset mode will automatically deactivate smoothing.</p><p>The Slide to Mod option transforms MPE slide messages to Mod Wheel (CC1) messages, allowing to modulate non-MPE enabled instruments with an MPE controller.</p></section><section id="notepb" data-number="1.3.5.3"><h4 data-number="29.3.5.3"><span class="header-section-number">29.3.5.3</span> NotePB</h4><p>The NotePB source modifies the MPE per-note pitch bend data, which is produced by horizontal movement on the controller’s keys or pads.

For example, a setting of 2x allows mapping an MPE controller with a +/- 48 semitone pitch bend range to an instrument whose pitch bend range is +/- 24 semitones. (Tip: If the Note Pitch Bend MIDI CC is mapped to anything other than pitch, using higher values helps to cover a larger modulation range with a smaller movement.)</p><p>When the NotePB to PB switch is switched on, MPE per-note pitch bend messages are translated to standard MIDI CC messages, which makes it possible for MPE-enabled MIDI controllers to still send MIDI information to instruments that do not receive MPE messages.</p></section></section><section id="note-echo" data-number="1.3.6"><h3 data-number="29.3.6"><span class="header-section-number">29.3.6</span> Note Echo</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MaxNoteEcho.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Note Echo Effect.</figcaption></figure><p>(Note: the Note Echo effect is not available in the Intro or Lite Editions.)</p><p>Note Echo is an echo delay effect that creates additional MIDI notes at specific time intervals with decreasing velocity.</p><p>Activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time beat division chooser.

This chapter describes the details of mapping to the following specific types of controls in Live’s user interface:</p><ol type="1"><li><em>Session View slots</em> — Note that MIDI and computer key assignments are bound to the slots, not to the clips they contain.</li><li><em>Switches and buttons</em> — among them the Track and Device Activator switches, the Control Bar’s tap tempo, metronome and transport controls.</li><li><em>Radio buttons</em> — A radio button selects from among a number of options. One instance of a radio button is the crossfader assignment section in each track, which offers three options: The track is assigned to the crossfader’s A position, the track is unaffected by the crossfader, or the track is affected by the crossfader’s B position.</li><li><em>Continuous controls</em> — like the mixer’s volume, pan and sends.</li><li><em>The crossfader</em>, the behavior of which is described in detail in the respective section of the Mixing chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#using-lives-crossfader">‘Using Live’s Crossfader’</a>).</li></ol><section id="midi-remote-control" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="30.1"><span class="header-section-number">30.1</span> MIDI Remote Control</h2><p>Live can be controlled remotely by external MIDI control surfaces, such as MIDI keyboards or controller boxes. Live also offers dedicated control via Ableton Push 1 (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-1/#using-push-1">‘Using Push 1’</a>) and Push 2 (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#using-push-2">‘Using Push 2’</a>).</p><p>Before we explain how remote control assignments are made and implemented, let’s first make the distinction between MIDI remote control and a separate use of MIDI in Live: as the input for our MIDI tracks. Let’s suppose that you are using a MIDI keyboard to play an instrument in one of Live’s MIDI tracks. If you assign C-1 on your MIDI keyboard to a Session View Clip Launch button, that key will cease playing C-1 of your MIDI track’s instrument, as it now ”belongs” solely to the Clip Launch button.</p><p><em>MIDI keys that become part of remote control assignments can no longer be used as input for MIDI tracks</em>. This is a common cause of confusion that can be easily resolved by observing the Control Bar’s MIDI indicators (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#midi-in-out-indicators">‘MIDI In/Out Indicators’</a>).</p><p>Before making any MIDI assignments, you will need to set up Live to recognize your control surfaces. This is done in the Link/Tempo/MIDI tab of Live’s Preferences, which can be opened with the <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>(Mac) keyboard shortcut .</p><section id="natively-supported-control-surfaces" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="30.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">30.1.1</span> Natively Supported Control Surfaces</h3><p>Control Surfaces are defined via the menus in the Link/Tempo/MIDI tab.

If this is the case, the <em>Dump</em> button to the right of your control surface’s choosers in the Live Preferences will become enabled. Before pressing it, verify that your control surface is ready to receive preset dumps. The method for enabling this varies for each manufacturer and product, so consult your hardware’s documentation if you are unsure. Finally, press the Dump button; Live will then set up your hardware automatically.</p><section id="instant-mappings" data-number="1.1.1.1"><h4 data-number="30.1.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">30.1.1.1</span> Instant Mappings</h4><p>In most cases, Live uses a standard method for mapping its functions and parameters to physical controls. This varies, of course, depending upon the configuration of knobs, sliders and buttons on the control surface. These feature-dependent configurations are known as <em>instant mappings</em>.</p><p>Within Live’s built-in lessons, you will find a <em>Control Surface Reference</em> that lists all currently supported hardware, complete with the details of their instant mappings. Lessons can be accessed at any time by selecting the Help View option from the View menu.</p><p><em>Note</em>: You can always <em>manually override</em> any instant mappings with your own assignments. In this case, you will also want to enable the Remote switches for the MIDI ports that your control surface is using. This is done in the MIDI Ports section of the Link, Tempo &amp; MIDI Preferences tab, and is described in the next section.</p><p>Instant mappings are advantageous because the control surface’s controllers will automatically reassign themselves in order to control the currently selected device in Live.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/StatusBarControlSurfaceFocusConfirmation.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Control Surfaces Can Follow Device Selection.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to following device selection, <em>natively supported</em> control surfaces can be ”locked” to specific devices, guaranteeing hands-on access no matter where the current focus is in your Live Set.

Live needs to be able to communicate with such control surfaces when a value has changed so that they can update the positions of their motorized faders or the status of their LEDs to match.</p><p>To test your setup, try sending some MIDI data to Live from your control surface.

Three takeover modes are available:</p><p><em>None</em> — As soon as the physical control is moved, its new value is sent immediately to its destination parameter, usually resulting in abrupt value changes.</p><p><em>Pick-Up</em> — Moving the physical control has no effect until it reaches the value of its destination parameter. As soon as they are equal, the destination value tracks the control’s value 1:1. This option can provide smooth value changes, but it can be difficult to estimate exactly where the pick-up will take place.</p><p><em>Value Scaling</em> — This option ensures smooth value transitions. It compares the physical control’s value to the destination parameter’s value and calculates a smooth convergence of the two as the control is moved. As soon as they are equal, the destination value tracks the control’s value 1:1.</p></section></section><section id="the-mapping-browser" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="30.2"><span class="header-section-number">30.2</span> The Mapping Browser</h2><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MappingBrowserMIDI.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Mapping Browser.</figcaption></figure><p>All manual MIDI, computer keyboard (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/midi-and-key-remote-control/#computer-keyboard-remote-control">‘Computer Keyboard Remote Control’</a>) and Macro Control (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/instrument-drum-and-effect-racks/#macro-controls">‘Macro Controls’</a>) mappings are managed by the <em>Mapping Browser</em>.

These messages can produce the following effects on controls in Live:</p><ul><li><em>Session View Slots</em> — Note On and Note Off messages affect clips in the slot according to their Launch Mode settings (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/launching-clips/#launch-modes">‘Launch Modes’</a>).</li><li><em>Switches</em> — A Note On message toggles the switch’s state.</li><li><em>Radio Buttons</em> — Note On messages toggle through the available options.</li><li><em>Variable Parameters</em> — When assigned to a single note, Note On messages toggle the parameter between its Min and Max values.

These values lead to different results depending on the type of Live control to which they are assigned. A value message of 127, for example, might turn the Volume control on a Live track all the way up or play a Session View clip. Specifically, MIDI controller messages from 0 to 127 can produce the following effects on controls in Live:</p><ul><li><em>Session View Slots</em> — Controller values 64 and above are treated like Note On messages. Controller values 63 and below are treated like Note Off messages.</li><li><em>Switches</em> — For track activators and on/off buttons in devices, controller values that are within the mapping’s Min and Max range turn the switch on. Controller values that are above or below this range turn it off. You can reverse this behavior by setting a Min value that is higher than its corresponding Max value. In this case, controller values that are outside of the range turn the switch on, while values inside the range turn it off. For all other switches (such as transport controls), controller values 64 and above turn the switch on, while controller values below 64 turn it off.</li><li><em>Radio Buttons</em> — The controller’s 0…127 value range is mapped onto the range of available options.</li><li><em>Continuous Controls</em> — The controller’s 0…127 value range is mapped onto the parameter’s range of values.</li></ul><p>Live also supports pitch bend messages and high-precision (”14-bit Absolute”) controller messages with a 0…16383 value range. The above specifications apply to these as well, except that the value range’s center is at 8191/8192.</p></section><section id="mapping-to-relative-midi-controllers" data-number="1.2.4"><h3 data-number="30.2.4"><span class="header-section-number">30.2.4</span> Mapping to Relative MIDI Controllers</h3><p>Some MIDI controllers can send ”value increment” and ”value decrement” messages instead of absolute values. These controls prevent parameter jumps when the state of a control in Live and the corresponding control on the hardware MIDI controller differ. For example, imagine that you have assigned the pan knob on your control surface to the pan parameter of a track in Live. If the hardware control is panned hard right, and the Live control is panned hard left, a slight movement in a hardware pan knob that sends absolute values would tell Live to pan right, causing an abrupt jump in the track’s panning. A pan knob sending relative messages would prevent this, since its incremental message to Live would simply say, ”Pan slightly to the left of your current position.”</p><p>There are four types of relative controllers: Signed Bit, Signed Bit 2, Bin Offset and Twos Complement.</p><p>Each of these are also available in a ”linear” mode. Some MIDI encoders use ”acceleration” internally, generating larger changes in value when they are turned quickly. For control surfaces that are not natively supported, Live tries to detect the controller type and whether acceleration is being used or not.</p><p>You can improve the detection process by moving the relative controller slowly to the left when you make an assignment. Live will offer its suggestion in the Status Bar’s ”mode” chooser, but if you happen to know the relative controller type, you can manually select it.</p><p>Live will do the following with relative MIDI controller messages:</p><ul><li><em>Session View Slots</em> — Value increment messages are treated like Note On messages. Value decrement messages are treated like Note Off messages.</li><li><em>Switches</em> — Increment messages turn the switch on. Decrement messages turn it off.</li><li><em>Radio Buttons</em> — Increment messages make the radio button jump forward to the next available option. Decrement messages make it jump backward.</li><li><em>Continuous Controls</em> — Each type of relative MIDI controller uses a different interpretation of the 0…127 MIDI controller value range to identify value increments and decrements:</li></ul><p>Please consult the documentation that came with your MIDI controller if you need further information on relative MIDI controllers.</p><section id="relative-session-view-navigation" data-number="1.2.4.1"><h4 data-number="30.2.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">30.2.4.1</span> Relative Session View Navigation</h4><p>Notice that you can make not only <em>absolute mappings</em> to individual slots and scenes, but also <em>relative mappings</em> to move the highlighted scene and operate on the highlighted clips.</p><p>In both MIDI Map Mode and Key Map Mode (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/midi-and-key-remote-control/#computer-keyboard-remote-control">‘Computer Keyboard Remote Control’</a>), a strip of assignable controls appears below the Session grid:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/RelativeSessionMap.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Relative Session Mapping Strip.</figcaption></figure><ol type="1"><li>Assign these buttons to keys, notes or controllers to move the highlighted scene up and down.</li><li>Assign this scene number value box to a MIDI controller — preferably an endless encoder — to scroll through the scenes.

In the studio, Push 1 allows you to quickly create clips that populate Live’s Session View as you work entirely from the hardware. On stage, Push 1 serves as a powerful instrument for clip launching.</p><p>Push 1’s controls are divided into a number of sections, as shown in the diagram below.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/PushOverview.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Overview of Push 1’s Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>Much of Push 1’s behavior depends on which <em>mode</em> it is in, as well as on which <em>type of track</em> is selected. To help you learn how to work with Push 1, this chapter will walk you through some of the fundamental workflows, and then will provide a reference of all of Push 1’s controls.</p><p>There are also a number of videos that will help you get started with Push 1. These are available at https://www.ableton.com/learn-push/</p><section id="setup" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="31.1"><span class="header-section-number">31.1</span> Setup</h2><p>Setting up the Push 1 hardware is mostly automatic. As long as Live is running, Push 1 will be automatically detected as soon as it is connected to a USB port on your computer. After connection, Push 1 can be used immediately. It is not necessary to install drivers and Push 1 does not need to be manually configured in Live’s Preferences.</p></section><section id="browsing-and-loading-sounds" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="31.2"><span class="header-section-number">31.2</span> Browsing and Loading Sounds</h2><p>You can browse and load sounds directly from Push 1, without needing to use Live’s browser. This is done in Push 1’s Browse Mode.</p><p>Press Push 1’s Browse button:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/PushBrowseButton.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=181"><figcaption>The Browse Button.</figcaption></figure><p>In Browse Mode, the display shows all of your available sounds and effects, as well as locations from the Places section of Live’s browser (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-the-browser/#places">‘Places’</a>). The display is divided into columns. The far left column shows either the specific type of device being browsed or the Places label. Each column to the right shows the next subfolder (if any exist). Use the In and Out buttons to shift the display to the right or left, allowing you to browse deeper levels of subfolders or view a larger number of presets on the display.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/PushInOutButtons.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=145"><figcaption>In and Out Buttons.</figcaption></figure><p>Navigate up via the Selection Control button (the first row below the display) in each column. Navigate down one folder via the State Control button for each level (the second row below the display). Samples and presets from official Packs or Live’s Core Library will preview when selected in the browser. To load a device preset, press the green button on the right. To load the default preset of the selected device, press the green button on the left.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/PushBrowseLoadButtons.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Loading Devices or Device Presets in Browse Mode.</figcaption></figure><p>You can scroll quickly through folders and subfolders via the encoders. Holding Shift while pressing the up or down buttons will move by a whole page.</p><p>After pressing a device or preset load button, the button will turn amber. This indicates that the currently selected entry is loaded; if you navigate to a different entry, the button will turn green again. Tip: pressing an amber load button will load the <em>next</em> entry in the list, allowing you to quickly try out presets or devices.</p><p>What you see when in Browse Mode depends on the device that was last selected. If you were working with an instrument, Browse Mode will show you replacement instruments. If you were working with an effect, you will see effects. When starting with an empty MIDI track, the display shows all of your available sounds, instruments, drum kits, effects, and Max for Live devices (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/max-for-live/#max-for-live">‘Max for Live’</a>), as well as VST and Audio Units instruments (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/working-with-instruments-and-effects/#using-plug-ins">‘Using Plug-Ins’</a>). Folders are only visible on Push 1 if they contain items that can be loaded at any particular time. For example, the Samples label (as well as any of your own folders in Places that only contain samples) won’t be visible unless you’re browsing from a single pad in a Drum Rack (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-1/#loading-individual-drums">‘Loading Individual Drums’</a>).</p></section><section id="playing-and-programming-beats" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="31.3"><span class="header-section-number">31.3</span> Playing and Programming Beats</h2><p>To create beats using Push 1, first make sure Note Mode is enabled.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/PushNoteModeButton.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=126"><figcaption>The Note Mode Button.</figcaption></figure><p>Then use Browse Mode to load one of the Drum Rack presets from Live’s library.</p><p>When working with a MIDI track containing a Drum Rack, Push 1’s 8x8 pad grid can be configured in a few different ways, depending on the state of the Note button.

In the studio, Push 2 allows you to quickly create clips that populate Live’s Session View as you work entirely from the hardware. On stage, Push 2 serves as a powerful instrument for real-time playing, step sequencing, and clip launching.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2Overview.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Overview of Push 2’s Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>Much of Push 2’s behavior depends on which <em>mode</em> it is in, as well as on which <em>type of track</em> is selected. To help you learn how to work with Push 2, this chapter will walk you through some of the fundamental workflows, and then will provide a reference of all of Push 2’s controls.</p><p>There are also a number of videos that will help you get started with Push 2. These are available at https://www.ableton.com/learn-push/</p><section id="setup" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="32.1"><span class="header-section-number">32.1</span> Setup</h2><p>After plugging in the included power supply and connecting the USB cable to your computer, turn Push 2 on via the power button in the back. From here, setting up the Push 2 hardware is mostly automatic. As long as Live is running, Push 2 will be automatically detected as soon as it is connected to a USB port on your computer. After connection, Push 2 can be used almost immediately. It is not necessary to install drivers and Push 2 does not need to be manually configured in Live’s Preferences.</p><p>From time to time, Ableton will release firmware updates for Push 2 that will be included in updates to Live. When using Push 2 for the first time after installing a new version of Live, you may be prompted to update the firmware.

The default settings are a Layout of “4ths” and a Direction of “Vert.” In this configuration, each pad is a 4th higher than the pad directly below it. Changing the Layout to “3rds“ means that each pad is now a 3rd higher than the pad directly below it. The “Sequent” layout puts all notes sequentially in order. This layout is useful if you need a very large range of notes available, because it has no duplicated notes.</p><p>Changing the Direction control to “Horiz.” rotates the pad grid 90 degrees. For example, with a Layout of “4ths,” each pad is a 4th higher than the pad to its left.</p><p><em>Fixed Off/On</em>: The lower right display button toggles Fixed on or off. When Fixed is on, the notes on the pad grid remain in the same positions when you change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play C (except in keys that don’t contain a C, in which case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in the key.) When Fixed is off, the notes on the pad grid shift so that the bottom-left pad always plays the root of the selected key.</p><p><em>In Key/Chromatic</em>: The lower left display button toggles between In Key and Chromatic. With In Key selected, the pad grid is effectively “folded” so that only notes within the key are available. In Chromatic Mode, the pad grid contains all notes. Notes that are in the key are lit, while notes that are not in the key are unlit.</p><p>Scale options are saved with the Set, and Push 2 will return to these settings when the Set is loaded again. Tip: If you have particular key and scale settings that you like to use all the time, you can save them in your Default Set (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#template-sets">‘Template Sets’</a>).

The instrument that powers Push 2’s sample playback functionality is Simpler, and we recommend reading the detailed Simpler chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#simpler">‘Simpler’</a>) to learn more about its functionality.</p><p>To start working with a sample, you can either add a new MIDI track or press Browse to enter Browse Mode on an existing MIDI track. Although you can load an empty Simpler to a track, it isn’t playable until it contains a sample. Push 2’s display will inform you that your Simpler is empty and suggest browsing for a sample:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2EmptySimpler.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Press Browse to Load a Sample in an Empty Simpler.</figcaption></figure><p>After loading a sample and switching to Device View, you will see the sample’s waveform in Push 2’s display, along with a number of parameters that allow you to quickly adjust how the sample plays back. This is the main bank of Simpler’s controls.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2SimplerMain.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Simpler’s Main Parameter Bank in the Display.</figcaption></figure><p>By default, Simpler will automatically set certain parameters based on the length of the loaded sample. For example, short samples will play once when triggered, while long samples will be set to loop and <em>warp</em>. Warped samples will play back at the tempo of your Set, regardless of which note you play. Bringing a warped clip into Simpler from an audio track, the browser, or your desktop preserves any warp settings and markers that were in the original clip. For more information about warping, see the Audio Clips, Tempo, and Warping chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#audio-clips-tempo-and-warping">‘Audio Clips, Tempo, and Warping’</a>).</p><p>The most important parameter that determines how Simpler will treat samples is the Mode control, which is used to choose one of Simpler’s three playback modes.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2SimplerMode.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Simpler’s Mode Parameter.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><em>Classic Playback Mode</em> is the default mode when using Simpler, and is optimized for creating “conventional” melodic and harmonic instruments using pitched samples. It features a complete ADSR envelope and supports looping, allowing for samples to sustain as long as a note is held down. Classic Mode is polyphonic by default, and the pad grid uses the same layout in this mode as is used when playing other pitched instruments.</li><li><em>One-Shot Playback Mode</em> is exclusively for monophonic playback, and is optimized for use with one-shot drum hits or short sampled phrases. This mode has simplified envelope controls and does not support looping. By default, the entire sample will play back when a note is triggered, regardless of how long the note is held. The pad grid in One-Shot Mode also uses the melodic layout.</li><li><em>Slicing Playback Mode</em> non-destructively slices the sample so that the individual slices can be played back from the pads. You can create and move slices manually, or choose from a number of different options for how Simpler will automatically create slices. This mode is ideal for working with rhythmic drum breaks.</li></ul><section id="classic-playback-mode" data-number="1.8.1"><h3 data-number="32.8.1"><span class="header-section-number">32.8.1</span> Classic Playback Mode</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2SimplerClassicMain.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Simpler’s Main Bank in Classic Mode.</figcaption></figure><p>In Classic Mode, the various sample position controls change which portion of the sample you play back. For example, if you load a drum break that contains silence at the beginning, you can start playback from after the silence. The Start control sets the absolute position in the sample from which playback could start, while the End control sets where playback could end; these parameters define the <em>region</em> of the sample that can be worked with. S Start and S Length are represented in percentages of the total sample length enabled by Start and End. For example, hitting a pad after setting an S Start value of 50% and S Length value of 25% will play back the third quarter (50-75%) of the region between the Start and End values. S Loop Length determines how much of the available sample (also determined by the Start and End values) will loop. Note that this parameter is only active if Loop is enabled.</p><p>Adjust the Zoom encoder to zoom into a portion of the waveform. The display shows a representation of the whole sample, as well as the currently active region. Turning the Zoom encoder clockwise zooms in. The specific portion of the sample that you zoom to is determined by the last-touched sample position control (Start, End, S Start, S Length, or S Loop Length.)</p><p>Pressing Simpler’s upper display button will enter Edit Mode. When in Edit Mode, the lower display buttons select additional pages of parameters and the upper display buttons toggle certain settings on or off. Pressing Simpler’s upper display button again will exit Edit Mode.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2SimplerClassicEdit.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Additional Parameters Available in Edit Mode.</figcaption></figure><p>Pressing the Loop On/Off button determines whether or not the sample will loop when a pad is held down. The Warp as… button adjusts the warping of the sample between the Start and End values so that it will play back precisely within the specified number of bars. Live makes its best guess about what this value should be based on the length of the sample, but if it gets it wrong, you can use the ÷2 or ×2 buttons to double or halve the playback speed, respectively.</p><p>Crop removes the portions of the sample that are outside of the Start and End points, while Reverse plays the entire sample backwards. Note that both Crop and Reverse are non-destructive; they create a copy of the sample and apply the process to the copy, so your original sample is not changed.</p></section><section id="one-shot-mode" data-number="1.8.2"><h3 data-number="32.8.2"><span class="header-section-number">32.8.2</span> One-Shot Mode</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2SimplerOneShotEdit.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Simpler’s Main Bank in One-Shot Mode With Additional Edit Mode Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>In One-Shot Mode, the Zoom, Start, and End controls function the same as in Classic Mode, as do the Warp as…, ÷2, ×2, Crop, and Reverse buttons.</p><p>With Trigger enabled, the sample will continue playing even after the pad is released; the amount of time you hold the pad has no effect when Trigger is on. You can shape the volume of the sample using the Fade In and Fade Out encoders. Fade In determines how long it takes the sample to reach its maximum volume after a pad is hit, while Fade Out begins a fade out the specified amount of time before the end of the sample region. (Note: to stop a one-shot sample immediately, hold Shift while pressing the Play/Stop button.)</p><p>With Gate enabled, the sample will begin fading out as soon as you release the pad. The Fade Out time determines how long it will take to fade to silence after release.</p><p>The Transpose encoder allows you to transpose the sample up or down by up to 48 semitones (four octaves). Note that when transposing, the timbre of the sample may change dramatically depending on which warp mode you’ve selected. The Gain encoder sets the overall volume of the Simpler instrument.</p><section id="legato-playback" data-number="1.8.2.1"><h4 data-number="32.8.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">32.8.2.1</span> Legato Playback</h4><p>Classic and One-Shot Modes provide a unique way of repitching a sample on the fly, without changing its playback position. (This is essentially a playable version of Legato Mode in clips (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/launching-clips/#legato-mode">‘Legato Mode’</a>).) To enable this functionality:</p><ol type="1"><li>In Edit Mode, press the second lower display button to view the Global parameter bank.</li><li>Set the Glide Mode parameter to Glide.</li><li>Set the Voices parameter to 1. (Note that this parameter is only available in Classic Mode. In One-Shot Mode, playback is always monophonic.)</li></ol><p>Now, as you play the pads legato, the sample will transpose without changing playback position. For best results, make sure Warp is on (in the Warp parameter bank). The Complex Pro warp mode tends to sound best when transposing, but experiment with the various warp modes to see which one works best for your particular sample.</p></section></section><section id="slicing-mode" data-number="1.8.3"><h3 data-number="32.8.3"><span class="header-section-number">32.8.3</span> Slicing Mode</h3><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push2SimplerSlicingEdit.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Simpler’s Main Bank in Slicing Mode With Additional Edit Mode Controls.</figcaption></figure><p>In Slicing Mode, the Zoom, Start, and End controls function the same as in Classic and One-Shot Modes, as do the Warp as…, ÷2, ×2, and Reverse buttons.</p><p>The Slice By chooser determines the specific way in which slices will be created:</p><ul><li><em>Transient</em> - Slices are placed on the sample’s transients automatically. The Sensitivity encoder determines how sensitive Simpler is to transient levels within the sample, and thus how many slices will be automatically created. Higher numbers result in more slices, up to a maximum of 64 slices.</li><li><em>Beat</em> - Slices are placed at musical beat divisions. The Division encoder selects the beat division at which Simpler will slice the sample region.</li><li><em>Region</em> - Slices are placed at equal time divisions. The Regions encoder selects the number of evenly-spaced slices that will be created.</li><li><em>Manual</em> - When Manual is selected, no slices are placed automatically. Instead, slices are created manually by enabling Pad Slicing and tapping empty pads as the sample plays back. To create manual slices:</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>Tap a pad that contains a slice to begin playback from that slice.</li><li>When the sample reaches the point at which you would like to create an additional slice (a drum hit, for example), tap any empty pad.</li><li>A slice will be placed at this point and it will be assigned to a pad. Any pads that were already assigned after this point will be shifted “upward” on the pad grid.</li><li>Once the loop is sliced as you like it, turn Pad Slicing off.</li></ol><p>In all slicing modes, slices are laid out from left to right in groups of four starting from the bottom left pad. Each additional four slices is placed on the next four pads up. After the left half of the pad grid is used, slices are placed along the bottom row on the right side of the pad grid, again moving upwards in groups of four.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/Push264Slices.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Up to 64 Slices Can Be Created.</figcaption></figure><p>By default, the pad grid uses the 64-pad drum layout when in Slicing Mode. Pressing the Layout button cycles between 64-pad, Loop Selector, and 16 Velocities modes.</p><p>The Playback encoder determines how many slices can be triggered simultaneously. Mono is monophonic; only one pad can be played or sequenced at a time. When set to Poly, multiple pads can be triggered together. When set to Through, playback is monophonic, but triggering one slice will continue playback through the rest of the sample region.</p><p>The Trigger/Gate switch is the same concept as in One-Shot Playback Mode, but what you actually hear depends on which Playback mode is selected.</p><p>Nudge allows you to adjust the position of each slice marker. This is especially useful for fine-tuning slices that you’ve created in Manual mode. For greater nudging accuracy, tap the pad you’d like to adjust and use the Zoom encoder to get a closer look. Hold Shift while adjusting Nudge for extremely small adjustments.</p><p>Split Slice creates a new slice in the middle of the currently selected slice. This is also useful in Manual mode, in conjunction with Nudge, for fine-tuning slices created via Pad Slicing.</p><p>To delete a slice (either manually or automatically created), hold Delete and tap the corresponding pad.</p></section></section><section id="navigating-in-note-mode" data-number="1.9"><h2 data-number="32.9"><span class="header-section-number">32.9</span> Navigating in Note Mode</h2><p>Now that you’ve created a few tracks, you can continue to add more.

Hold Quantize and press a drum pad to quantize that pad’s notes. For audio clips, Quantize will affect transients. Press and hold Quantize to access quantization settings. After changing these settings, press once to exit and then press and release to apply your changes.</p><p>Duplicate — In Scene Workflow, Duplicate creates a new scene containing all of the currently playing clips. In Clip Workflow, Duplicate creates a copy of the currently selected clip in the next clip slot, while continuing playback of any currently playing clips in other tracks. Hold Duplicate while pressing a Drum Rack pad to copy the pad and paste it to a new location in the Drum Rack. Hold Duplicate while pressing a track selection button to duplicate that track. In Session Mode, hold Duplicate and press a clip to copy it. Continue holding Duplicate and tap another clip slot to paste the clip there.</p><p>New — Pressing New stops the selected clip and prepares Live to record new material. This allows you to practice before making a new recording.</p><p>Fixed Length — When enabled, all newly created clips will be a fixed number of bars. When disabled, new clips will continue to record until you press the Record, New or Play/Stop buttons. Press and hold, then use the lower display buttons to specify the fixed recording length. Tip: enabling Fixed Length <em>while</em> recording will switch recording off and loop the last few bars of the clip, depending on the Fixed Length setting.</p><p>Automate — Toggles Live’s Automation Record button. When on, your parameter changes will be recorded into playing Session View clips. Hold Shift and press Automate to reenable any automation that you have overridden. Hold Delete and press the Automation button to delete all automation in a clip.</p><p>Record — With the Session View focused in Live, press the Record button to begin recording a Session clip. Pressing Record again will stop recording but will continue playing back the clip. Pressing Record a third time will enable overdub mode, allowing you to record into the clip while it plays back. Hold Record and press the lower display button for a track to manually arm it. With the Arrangement View focused in Live, pressing Record will toggle Arrangement Recording on and off. You can also trigger Arrangement Recording while Live’s Session View is in focus by holding Shift and pressing Record. Note that this behavior is reversed when the Arrangement is in focus; holding Shift and pressing Record will then toggle Session recording.</p><p>Play/Stop — Toggles the play button in Live’s transport bar. While already stopped, hold Shift and press Play/Stop to return Live’s transport to 1.1.1 without starting playback.</p><p>Touch Strip — When an instrument track is selected, the touch strip adjusts pitch bend or modulation wheel amount when playing in real-time, or the available range of notes when step sequencing. Pitch bend is selected by default when an instrument track is selected. To change the functionality of the touch strip, hold Select and tap the strip. This toggles between pitch bend and mod wheel functionality each time you tap it. The display will briefly show the current mode each time you change it. Note that pitch bend and modulation wheel functionality is only available when playing instruments in real time, and not when using the Melodic Sequencer. When a Drum Rack track is selected, the touch strip selects the Drum Rack bank.</p><p>Encoders and display buttons — The encoders and the two banks of eight buttons above and below the display change function depending on a variety of factors, including the selected track type, the current mode, etc. In all modes, the far-right encoder controls the volume of the Main track (or the Pre-Cue volume if Shift is held.) Holding Shift while adjusting any of the encoders allows you to fine-tune whichever parameter is currently being controlled by that encoder.</p><p>Add Device — Opens Browse Mode to add a new device to the currently selected track. Devices will load to the right of the previously-selected device, although note that MIDI effects will always be placed before the instrument in the track and audio effects will always be placed after it.</p><p>Add Track — Puts Push 2 into Browse Mode, allowing you to select which type of track you’d like to add (MIDI, Audio, or Return) and optionally load a device to the new track at the same time. If the Add Track button is pressed while a track within a Group Track is selected, any new tracks will be inserted into that Group Track.</p><p>Master — Press the Master button to select the Main track. Press Master again to return to the previously selected track.</p><p>Scene/Grid buttons — These buttons change their functionality depending on whether Session Mode or Note Mode is selected. When Session Mode is selected, these buttons launch Session View scenes. (Tip: hold the Select button while pressing a Scene button to select the scene without launching it.) When Note Mode is selected, the Scene/Grid buttons determine the rhythmic resolution of the step sequencer grid and the rhythmic resolution of repeated notes (when Repeat is enabled.)</p><p>Setup — Press to adjust brightness, the sensitivity of Push 2’s velocity response, and other settings (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#setup-menu">‘Setup Menu’</a>).</p><p>User — All of Push 2’s built-in functionality can be disabled via User Mode. This allows Push 2 to be reprogrammed to control alternate functions in Live or other software. (Tip: Push 2’s relative encoders work best in “Relative (2’s Comp.)” mode. To ensure this mode is selected, turn the encoder slowly to the left during mapping.)</p><p>Device — Press to enter Device Mode, which allows you to use the encoders and upper display buttons to control parameters in Live’s devices and third-party plug-ins (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#working-with-instruments-and-effects">‘Working With Instruments and Effects’</a>). While in another mode, press and hold to temporarily toggle to Device Mode. Releasing the button will then return to the previous mode.</p><p>Browse — Press to enter Browse Mode, where you can load instruments and effects to tracks. (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#browsing-and-loading-sounds">‘Browsing and Loading Sounds’</a>)</p><p>Mix — Each press of the Mix button toggles between Track Mix Mode and Global Mix Mode. In Track Mix Mode, the encoders adjust volume, pan, and send levels for the currently selected track. The lower display buttons are used to select the track (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#track-control-and-mixing">‘Track Control And Mixing’</a>). While in another mode, press and hold to temporarily toggle to Mix Mode. Releasing the button will then return to the previous mode.</p><p>Clip — Press to enter Clip Mode, where you can adjust parameters for the selected clip (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#clip-mode">‘Clip Mode’</a>). While in another mode, press and hold to temporarily toggle to Clip Mode. Releasing the button will then return to the previous mode.</p><p>Arrow Keys — Navigate through your Live Set (in Session Mode) and between tracks or scenes/clips (in Note Mode). In Browse Mode, use the arrows to move between columns of items in the browser.</p><p>Repeat — when Repeat is enabled, holding down a pad will retrigger the note. The Scene/Grid buttons change the rhythmic value of the repeated note. Press and hold Repeat to temporarily enable it.</p><p>Accent — when Accent is enabled, all incoming notes (whether step sequenced or played in real-time) are played at full velocity. Press and hold Accent to temporarily enable it.</p><p>Scale — When Note Mode is on and an instrument track is selected, pressing this button allows you to select which scale will be played on the pads. Note that this button has no effect when a Drum Rack track is selected or when in Session Mode.</p><ul><li>Fixed On/Off: When Fixed Mode is on, the notes on the pad grid remain in the same positions when you change keys; the bottom-left pad will always play C (except in keys that don’t contain a C, in which case the bottom-left pad will play the nearest note in the key.) When Fixed is off, the notes on the pad grid shift so that the bottom-left pad always plays the root of the selected key.</li><li>In Key/Chromatic: With In Key selected, the pad grid is effectively “folded” so that only notes within the key are available. In Chromatic Mode, the pad grid contains all notes. Notes that are in the key are lit, while notes that are not in the key are unlit.</li><li>Scale selection: Using the upper and lower display buttons, you can change the key played by the pad grid. You can change to a variety of scale types using encoders 2 through 7.</li></ul><p>Layout — Press to change the layout of the pad grid. When in Session Mode, Layout toggles the Session Overview on or off (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-push-2/#session-overview">‘Session Overview’</a>). When in Note Mode, the layout options depend on the type of track that is currently selected and the current mode.</p><ul><li>MIDI track containing an instrument — toggles between enabling the pad grid for realtime playing of notes and melodic step sequencing.</li><li>MIDI track containing a Drum Rack (or a Simpler in Slicing Mode) — toggles between the three-section pad grid (real-time playing, step sequencing, and loop length) and the 64-pad layout.</li></ul><p>Note — Press to enter Note Mode. When enabled, the pads change functionality based on the type of track that is currently selected. While in Session Mode, press and hold Note to temporarily toggle to Note Mode. Releasing the button will then return to Session mode.</p><ul><li>MIDI track containing an instrument — the pads plays notes (or slices of a sample, when using Simpler in Slicing Mode.) Pressing Layout toggles between real-time playing and step sequencing.</li><li>MIDI track containing a Drum Rack — with the Loop Selector layout selected, the pad grid is divided; the lower-left 16 pads play the Drum Rack, the lower-right 16 pads adjust the loop length of the clip, and the upper four rows control the step sequencer. Press Layout to switch to 16 Velocities layout. Here, the bottom right 16 pads represent 16 different velocities for the selected Drum Rack pad. Press Layout again to switch to the 64-pad layout, allowing you to play drums across the entire 8x8 pad grid.</li></ul><p>Session — Press to enter Session Mode. When enabled, the pad grid changes to launch clips in Live’s Session View. While in Note Mode, press and hold Session to temporarily toggle to Session Mode. Releasing the button will then return to Note Mode.</p><p>Octave Up/Down — If an instrument track is selected, these buttons shift the pads up or down by octave. If a Drum Rack is selected, these buttons shift the Drum Rack’s pad overview up or down by 16 pads. In Session Mode, these buttons shift control of the Session View up or down by eight scenes. These buttons will be unlit if no additional octaves are available.</p><p>Page Left/Right — When working with the drum or melodic step sequencers, these buttons navigate to the previous or next page of steps. In Session Mode, these buttons shift control of the Session View left or right by eight tracks.</p><p>Shift — Press and hold Shift while pressing other buttons to access additional functionality. Hold Shift while turning encoders for finer resolution.</p><p>Select — In Session Mode, hold Select and press a clip to select the clip without launching it. This will also display the clip name in the display. In Note Mode, hold Select and press a Drum Rack pad to select it without triggering the pad.</p><section id="footswitches" data-number="1.17.0.1"><h4 data-number="32.17.0.1"><span class="header-section-number">32.17.0.1</span> Footswitches</h4><p>Two ports on the back of Push 2 allow you to connect momentary footswitches. Footswitch 1 acts as a sustain pedal. Footswitch 2 gives you hands-free control of Push 2’s recording functionality. A single tap of the footswitch will toggle the Record button, thus switching between recording/overdubbing and playback of the current clip. Quickly double-tapping the footswitch is the same as pressing the New button.</p><p>Note that certain footswitches may behave “backwards”; for example, notes may sustain only when the pedal is <em>not</em> depressed. Footswitch polarity can usually be corrected by connecting the footswitch to the port while depressing it, but we recommend using footswitches with a physical polarity switch.</p></section></section></section></div>

Or, sometimes you might prefer not to use a rigid, computer-generated clock. For example, you might like Live’s tempo to follow the natural push and pull of a drummer in your band, or you might be trying to synchronize to a set of turntables during a DJ performance. This is where Tempo Follower comes in. Tempo Follower analyzes an incoming audio signal in real-time and interprets its tempo, allowing Live to follow along and keep in time.</p><section id="setting-up-tempo-follower" data-number="1.2.1"><h3 data-number="33.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">33.2.1</span> Setting Up Tempo Follower</h3><p>To set an external audio input as a source for Tempo Follower, first open Live’s Link, Tempo &amp; MIDI Preferences. In the Tempo Follower section, set the Input Channel (Ext. In) to the input on your audio interface that is connected to the source you wish to follow. For a drum kit, this might be a dedicated overhead microphone. For turntables, you might choose to use a record output or effects loop from a DJ mixer. Note that while Tempo Follower’s algorithm is optimized for use with audio signals that have a clear rhythm, you can also be creative and experiment with different sources.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TempoFollowerPreferences.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Tempo Follower Settings in Live’s Preferences.</figcaption></figure><p>When the “Show Tempo Follower Toggle” switch is set to “Show”, you will see a “Follow” button appear in the Control Bar, alongside the other tempo-related parameters, at the left-hand side.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/TempoFollowerToggle.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Follow Button in the Control Bar.</figcaption></figure><p>Activating the “Follow” button will turn on Tempo Follower, and Live will begin listening to the configured audio source and interpreting its tempo.

Live can still send MIDI clock information to external devices when Tempo Follower is enabled, but it cannot receive it.</p></section></section><section id="synchronizing-via-midi" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="33.3"><span class="header-section-number">33.3</span> Synchronizing via MIDI</h2><p>If you’re working with devices that don’t support Link, you can synchronize via MIDI. The MIDI protocol defines two ways to synchronize sequencers, both of which are supported by Live. Both protocols work with the notion of a sync <em>host</em>, which delivers a sync signal that is tracked by the sync <em>device(s)</em>.</p><p>MIDI Clock: MIDI Clock works like a metronome ticking at a fast rate. The rate of the incoming ticks is tempo-dependent: Changing the tempo at the sync host (e.g., a drum machine) will cause the device to follow the change. The MIDI Clock protocol also provides messages that indicate the song position. With respect to MIDI Clock, Live can act as both a MIDI sync host and device.</p><p>MIDI Timecode: MIDI Timecode is the MIDI version of the SMPTE protocol, the standard means of synchronizing tape machines and computers in the audio and film industry. A MIDI Timecode message specifies a time in seconds and frames (subdivisions of a second). Live will interpret a Timecode message as a position in the Arrangement. Timecode messages carry no meter-related information; when slaving Live to another sequencer using MIDI Timecode, you will have to adjust the tempo manually. Tempo changes cannot be tracked. Detailed MIDI Timecode preferences are explained later in this chapter (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/synchronizing-with-link-tempo-follower-and-midi/#midi-timecode-options">‘MIDI Timecode Options’</a>). With respect to MIDI Timecode, Live can only act as a MIDI sync device, not a host.</p><section id="synchronizing-external-midi-devices-to-live" data-number="1.3.1"><h3 data-number="33.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">33.3.1</span> Synchronizing External MIDI Devices to Live</h3><p>Live can send MIDI Clock messages to an external MIDI sequencer (or drum machine).

This can be useful in compensating for delays incurred by the signal transmission. The Sync Delay for a specific MIDI device appears as you select the MIDI device from the Link, Tempo &amp; MIDI Preferences’ MIDI Ports list. To adjust the delay, have both Live and the other sequencer play a rhythmical pattern with pronounced percussive sounds. While listening to the output from both, adjust the Sync Delay control until both sounds are in perfect sync.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MIDISyncDelay.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>Adjusting Sync Delay.</figcaption></figure></section></section></section></div>

An application like Live requires a powerful CPU and a fast hard disk. This section will provide some insight on these issues, and should help you avoid and solve problems with running audio on a computer.</p><section id="managing-the-cpu-load" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="34.1"><span class="header-section-number">34.1</span> Managing the CPU Load</h2><p>To output a continuous stream of sound through the audio hardware, Live has to perform a huge number of calculations every second. If the processor can’t keep up with what needs to be calculated, the audio will have gaps or clicks.</p><p>Factors that affect computational speed include processor clock rates (e.g., speed in MHz or GHz), architecture, temperature (in hot environments, modern CPUs will “thermal throttle” and slow down the CPU processing rate), memory cache performance (how efficiently a processor can grab data from memory) and system bus bandwidth — the computer’s “pipeline“ through which all data must pass.</p><p>Fortunately, Live supports multicore and multiprocessor systems, allowing the processing load from things like instruments, effects and I/O to be distributed among the available resources. Depending on the machine and the Live Set, the available processing power can be several times that of older systems.</p><section id="the-cpu-load-meter" data-number="1.1.1"><h3 data-number="34.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">34.1.1</span> The CPU Load Meter</h3><p>The Control Bar’s CPU meter displays how much of the computer’s computational potential is currently being used. For example, if the displayed percentage is 10 percent, the computer is just coasting along. If the percentage is 100 percent, the processing is being maxed out — it’s likely that you will hear gaps, clicks or other audio problems.</p><p>Note that the CPU meter takes into account only the load from processing audio, not other tasks the computer performs (e.g., managing Live’s user interface).</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/CpuMeter.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The CPU Load Meter.</figcaption></figure><p>The CPU meter can display the Average or Current CPU usage, or it can be switched off entirely.</p><p>The Average CPU meter displays the average amount of the CPU currently processing audio, rather than the overall CPU load.

This option can be re-enabled from the drop-down menu as needed by selecting Warn on Current CPU Overload.</p><p>To determine the CPU load, Live calculates the time it needs to process one audio buffer. This value is then compared to the time it takes to actually play one audio buffer.</p><p>For example, a value of 50% on the CPU meter means that Live is processing one audio buffer twice as fast as it takes to play the buffer.</p><p>Values over 100% are possible when the calculation takes more time than it does to play one audio buffer.</p><p>Live expects that the audio thread will have the highest priority, however the final prioritization of threads is done by the operating system, meaning Live’s processing might get interrupted. This is why other applications may cause CPU spikes in Live’s CPU meter.</p></section><section id="cpu-load-from-multichannel-audio" data-number="1.1.2"><h3 data-number="34.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">34.1.2</span> CPU Load from Multichannel Audio</h3><p>One source of constant CPU drain is the process of moving data to and from the audio hardware. This drain can be minimized by disabling any inputs and outputs that are not required in a project. There are two buttons in the Audio Preferences to access the Input and Output Configuration dialogs, which allow activating or deactivating individual ins and outs.</p><p>Live does not automatically disable unused channels, because the audio hardware drivers usually produce an audible “hiccup“ when there is a request for an audio configuration change.</p></section><section id="cpu-load-from-tracks-and-devices" data-number="1.1.3"><h3 data-number="34.1.3"><span class="header-section-number">34.1.3</span> CPU Load from Tracks and Devices</h3><p>Generally, every track and device being used in Live incurs some amount of CPU load. However, Live is “smart“ and avoids wasting CPU cycles on tracks and devices that do not contribute anything useful.</p><p>For example, dragging devices into a Live Set that is not running does not significantly increase the CPU load. The load increases only as you start playing clips or feed audio into the effects. When there is no incoming audio, the effects are deactivated until they are needed again. (If the effect produces a “tail,“ like reverbs and delays, deactivation occurs only after all calculations are complete.)</p><p>While this scheme is very effective at reducing the average CPU load of a Live Set, it cannot reduce the peak load. To make sure your Live Set plays back continuously, even under the most intense conditions, play back a clip in every track simultaneously, with all devices enabled.</p><p>In the Session View, it is possible to see each track’s impact on the CPU load by clicking on the Show/Hide Performance Impact selector in the Mixer Section.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SessionMixerPerTrackCPUMeterSelector.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Show/Hide Performance Impact selector.</figcaption></figure><p>In the Performance Impact section, each track has its own CPU meter with six rectangles that light up to indicate the relative impact of that track on the CPU level of the current Set. Freezing the track (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/computer-audio-resources-and-strategies/#track-freeze">‘Track Freeze’</a>) with the largest impact or removing devices from that track will usually reduce the CPU load.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/SessionViewPerTrackCPUMeterSection.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Session View’s Performance Impact Section.</figcaption></figure></section><section id="track-freeze" data-number="1.1.4"><h3 data-number="34.1.4"><span class="header-section-number">34.1.4</span> Track Freeze</h3><p>Live‘s Freeze Track command can greatly help in managing the CPU load incurred by devices and clip settings. When you select a track and execute the Freeze Track command, Live will create a sample file for each Session clip in the track, plus one for the Arrangement. Thereafter, clips in the track will simply play back their “freeze files“ rather than repeatedly calculating processor-intensive device and clip settings in real time. The Freeze Track command is available from Live‘s Edit menu and from the <kbd>right-click</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CTRL-click</kbd>(Mac) context menu of tracks and clips. Be aware that it is not possible to freeze a Group Track (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/mixing/#group-tracks">‘Group Tracks’</a>); you can only freeze tracks that hold clips.</p><p>Normally, freezing happens very quickly. But if you freeze a track that contains an External Audio Effect (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-audio-effect-reference/#external-audio-effect">‘External Audio Effect’</a>) or External Instrument (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/live-instrument-reference/#external-instrument">‘External Instrument’</a>) that routes to a hardware effects device or synthesizer, the freezing process happens in real-time. Live will automatically detect if real-time freezing is necessary, and you‘ll be presented with several options for managing the process. Please see the section on real-time rendering (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#real-time-rendering">‘Real-Time Rendering’</a>) for an explanation of these options.</p><p>Once any processing demands have been addressed (or you have upgraded your machine!), you can always select a frozen track and choose Unfreeze Track from the Edit menu to change device or clip settings. On slower machines, you can unfreeze processor-intensive tracks one at a time to make edits, freezing them again when you are done.</p><p>Many editing functions remain available to tracks that are frozen. Launching clips can still be done freely, and mixer controls such as volume, pan and the sends are still available. Other possibilities include:</p><ul><li>Edit, cut, copy, paste, duplicate and trim clips;</li><li>Draw and edit mixer automation and mixer clip envelopes;</li><li>Consolidate;</li><li>Record Session View clip launches into the Arrangement View;</li><li>Create, move and duplicate Session View scenes;</li><li>Drag frozen MIDI clips into audio tracks.</li></ul><p>When performing edits on frozen tracks that contain time-based effects such as reverb, you should note that the audible result may be different once the track is again unfrozen, depending on the situation. This is because, if a track is frozen, the applied effects are not being calculated at all, and therefore cannot change their response to reflect edited input material. When the track is again unfrozen, all effects will be recalculated in real time.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/FrozenClipReverbTail.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>A Frozen Arrangement Track with a Reverb Tail.</figcaption></figure><p>Frozen Arrangement View tracks will play back any relevant material extending beyond the lengths of their clips (e.g., the “tails“ of Reverb effects). These frozen tails will appear in the Arrangement as crosshatched regions located adjacent to their corresponding clips. They are treated by Live as separate, “temporary“ clips that disappear when unfrozen, since the effect is then calculated in real time. Therefore, when moving a frozen clip in the Arrangement, you will usually want to select the second, frozen tail clip as well, so that the two remain together.</p><p>For frozen Session clips, only two loop cycles are included in the frozen clip, which means that clips with unlinked clip envelopes (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-envelopes/#unlinking-clip-envelopes-from-clips">‘Unlinking Clip Envelopes From Clips’</a>) may play back differently after two loop cycles when frozen.</p><p>Dragging a frozen clip to the drop area in the Session View or Arrangement View will create a new frozen track containing that clip. If a clip is partially selected in the Arrangement, the new frozen track will contain the selected portion of the clip only.</p><p>The samples generated by the Freeze Track command are stored in your temporary recording folder until you save your Live Set, at which point they are moved to the following project folder sub-directory: Samples/Processed/Freeze. Please note that freeze files for tracks that contain an External Instrument or External Audio Effect will be discarded immediately when unfreezing.</p><p>You can also decide to flatten frozen tracks, which completely replaces the original clips and devices with their audible result. The Flatten command is available from the Edit menu.</p><p>Besides providing an opportunity to conserve CPU resources on tracks containing a large number of devices, the Track Freeze command simplifies sharing projects between computers. Computers that are a bit low on processing power can be used to run large Live Sets as long as any CPU-intensive tracks are frozen. This also means that computers lacking certain devices used in one Live Set can still play the Set when the relevant device tracks are frozen.</p></section></section><section id="managing-the-disk-load" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="34.2"><span class="header-section-number">34.2</span> Managing the Disk Load</h2><p>A hard drive’s access speed (which is related to, but not the same thing as rotational speed) can limit Live’s performance. Most audio-optimized computers use 7200 RPM or faster drives. Laptops, to save power, often use 5400 RPM or slower drives, which is why projects on laptops usually have lower track counts. The amount of disk traffic Live generates is roughly proportional to the number of audio channels being written or read simultaneously. A track playing a stereo sample causes more disk traffic than a track playing a mono sample.</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/DiskOverloadLed.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>The Disk Overload Indicator.</figcaption></figure><p>The Disk Overload indicator flashes when the disk was unable to read or write audio quickly enough.

As a result of this testing, we have implemented a number of low-level improvements to the audio engine. We have also written this fact sheet to help users understand exactly how their audio is (or is not) being modified when using certain features in Live that are often misunderstood, as well as tips for achieving the highest quality results.</p><p>As mentioned above, the focus of our research has been on objective (that is, quantifiable and measurable) behavior. We make no claims about what you can <em>hear</em> because we can‘t possibly predict the variables that make up your listening environment, audio hardware, hearing sensitivity, etc. Furthermore, this paper makes no claims about how Live compares to other audio software. Rather, it is a summary of measurable facts about what Live actually <em>does</em> under various conditions.</p><section id="testing-and-methodology" data-number="1.1"><h2 data-number="35.1"><span class="header-section-number">35.1</span> Testing and Methodology</h2><p>As of this writing, every version of Live is subjected to a suite of 473 automated tests that cover every aspect of Live‘s functionality. We add additional tests as we add features, and we will never release an update unless it passes every test.</p></section><section id="neutral-operations" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="35.2"><span class="header-section-number">35.2</span> Neutral Operations</h2><p>Procedures in Live that will cause absolutely no change in audio quality are referred to as <em>neutral operations</em>. You can be sure that using these functions will never cause any signal degradation. Applying neutral operations to audio that was recorded into Live ensures that the audio will be unchanged from the point of analog-to-digital conversion. Applying neutral operations to files imported into Live ensures that the imported audio will be identical to the files saved on disk. Applying neutral operations to files being exported from Live ensures that the quality of your output file will be at least as high as what you heard during playback.</p><p>The list of neutral operations found below is provided primarily as an abstract reference; while all of these operations are, in fact, neutral, it is important to remember that each of them may (and almost certainly will) occur within a context that also contains non-neutral operations. For example, running an audio signal through an effects device is a non-neutral operation. So any neutral operations that occur after it will, of course, still result in audio that is altered in some way. Even a gain change is, technically, non-neutral.</p><p>Neutral operations include:</p><section id="undithered-rendering" data-number="1.2.1"><h3 data-number="35.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.1</span> Undithered Rendering</h3><p>The Export Audio/Video (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#exporting-audio-and-video">‘Exporting Audio and Video’</a>) command renders Live’s audio output to a file on disk. Rendering is a neutral operation under certain conditions:</p><ul><li>the sample rate of the rendered file is the same as that set for the audio hardware in Live‘s Preferences.</li><li>no non-neutral operations have been applied.</li></ul><p>Live‘s rendering performance is tested by loading three types of unprocessed audio files (white noise, fixed-frequency sine waves and sine sweeps) in 16-, 24- and 32-bit word lengths and rendering these to output files, also with varying bit resolutions. Phase cancellation testing of the original and output files shows the following:</p><ul><li>rendering to a file with the same bit depth as the original results in complete phase cancellation.</li><li>rendering to a file with a higher bit depth than the original results in complete phase cancellation.</li><li>rendering to a file with a lower bit depth than the original results in the smallest amount of distortion possible within a 32-bit system.</li></ul></section><section id="matching-sample-rateno-transposition" data-number="1.2.2"><h3 data-number="35.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.2</span> Matching sample rate/no transposition</h3><p>Playback of an unstretched audio file in Live is a neutral operation, provided that the file‘s sample rate is the same as that set in Live‘s Preferences and that the file is played back without transposition. This is verified by cancellation tests of rendered output. Please note that “playback“ in this context refers only to the audio within Live, prior to the point at which it reaches your audio hardware.</p></section><section id="unstretched-beatstonestexturere-pitch-warping" data-number="1.2.3"><h3 data-number="35.2.3"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.3</span> Unstretched Beats/Tones/Texture/Re-Pitch Warping</h3><p>If the tempo of a Clip is the same as the tempo of the Set, that clip will play back unstretched. In this case, if the Warp mode (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#adjusting-for-good-stretching-quality">‘Adjusting for Good Stretching Quality’</a>) of the Clip is set to Beats, Tones, Texture or Re-Pitch (but not Complex or Complex Pro), playback will be neutral. Any Warping caused by changing the Set’s tempo is non-permanent, and audio that plays back unwarped at a given tempo will always play back unwarped at that tempo, even if the tempo is changed and then changed back. For example, if you’ve recorded some tracks at 120 BPM, but then decide you’d like to slow the tempo down to record a particularly difficult solo passage, the original tracks will play back neutrally again after returning the tempo to 120 BPM. Only the recording made at the slower tempo will be stretched. Please note that grooves (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/using-grooves/#using-grooves">‘Using Grooves’</a>) work by modifying the positions of Warp markers. This means that playback of audio clips with groove applied will be non-neutral even at the original tempo.</p><p>The neutrality of unstretched clip playback is verified by performing cancellation tests on rendered output.</p></section><section id="summing-at-single-mix-points" data-number="1.2.4"><h3 data-number="35.2.4"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.4</span> Summing at Single Mix Points</h3><p>Since version 7, Live uses double precision (64-bit) summing at all points where signals are mixed, including Clip and return track inputs, the Main track and Racks. Mixing in Live is thus a neutral operation for signals mixed at any single summing point. This is tested by loading pairs of 24-bit files (white noise and fixed-frequency sine waves and their phase-inverted complements), adding the pairs together eight times and rendering the output as 32-bit files. All tests result in perfect phase cancellation.</p><p>Please note that, while 64-bit summing is applied to each <em>single</em> mix point, Live‘s internal processing is still done at 32-bit. Thus, signals that are mixed across multiple summing points may still result in an extremely small amount of signal degradation. This combination of 64-bit summing within a 32-bit architecture strikes an ideal balance between audio quality and CPU/memory consumption.</p></section><section id="recording-external-signals-bit-depth-ad-converter" data-number="1.2.5"><h3 data-number="35.2.5"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.5</span> Recording external signals (bit depth &gt;/= A/D converter)</h3><p>Recording audio signals into Live is a neutral operation, provided that the bit depth set in Live‘s Preferences window is the same or higher than that of the A/D converters used for the recording. In this context, “neutral“ means “identical to the audio as it was delivered to Live by the A/D converters.“</p></section><section id="recording-internal-sources-at-32-bit" data-number="1.2.6"><h3 data-number="35.2.6"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.6</span> Recording internal sources at 32 bit</h3><p>Audio that is recorded via internal routing will be identical to the source audio, provided that the recording was made at 32 bits. To ensure neutral recordings of plug-in instruments and any audio signals that are being processed by effects plug-ins, internal recording at 32 bits is recommended. Please note, however, that if the source audio is already at a lower bit depth, internal recording at that bit depth will also be neutral (assuming that no effects are used); internally recording an unprocessed 16 bit audio file at 32 bits will not increase the sound quality.</p><p>The neutrality of internal recording is verified using cancellation tests.</p></section><section id="freeze-flatten" data-number="1.2.7"><h3 data-number="35.2.7"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.7</span> Freeze, Flatten</h3><p>When tracks are frozen (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/computer-audio-resources-and-strategies/#track-freeze">‘Track Freeze’</a>), the audio files that are created are 32 bit, which ensures that they will not be lower quality than the audio heard prior to freezing. But there are some special cases involving Freeze that result in non-neutral behavior and should be noted:</p><p>Frozen Arrangement View tracks can include audio material that extends beyond the end of the clip itself, such as reverb tails and delay repetitions. Frozen Session View tracks, however, are always exactly two loop cycles long, so any audio that extends beyond two loop cycles during un-frozen playback will be cut off after freezing.</p><p>Time-based effects like reverbs and delays are processed in realtime for unfrozen clips, so stopping playback during a reverb or delay tail will allow the tail to continue. In contrast, frozen tails are rendered as audio, and so will stop abruptly during playback.</p><p>Any parameter automations are rendered as part of the audio file for frozen Arrangement View clips. Frozen Session View clips, however, take a “snapshot“ of all parameter values at the Arranger‘s 1.1.1 position and retain them for the duration of the frozen clip. This is analogous to the behavior with unfrozen clips; when playing normal clips in Session View, any Arrangement automations are “punched out“ until the Back to Arrangement button is pressed.</p><p>Frozen clips are always played back with Warp on and in Beats mode, which means they are subject to the same non-neutral behavior as any other Warped audio files.</p><p>Any devices with random parameters (e.g., the Chance control in the Beat Repeat device) will no longer exhibit random behavior after freezing. This is because, as with time-based effects, the random values that were in place at the moment of freezing will be rendered as part of the new file, and will thus no longer be calculated in real-time.</p><p>Please note that the Flatten command replaces any original clips and devices with the audio files created by freezing. When using this command, it is important to keep in mind the special cases above — what you hear after freezing is exactly what you will get when flattening, so if the results are not to your liking, be sure to unfreeze and make any necessary changes to device parameters before invoking the Flatten command.</p><p>This procedure is tested by rendering the output of an audio track and comparing it to the frozen audio from the same track via phase cancellation to ensure that the files are identical.</p></section><section id="bypassed-effects" data-number="1.2.8"><h3 data-number="35.2.8"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.8</span> Bypassed Effects</h3><p>Bypassed effects in Live are removed from the signal flow. This is true for both Live‘s built-in effects devices and third-party VST and AU plug-ins. Consequently, audio at the output of a bypassed effect is identical to the audio at the input. Please note, however, that effects devices with parameters that inherently require delay (e.g., the Look Ahead settings in Compressor) will still introduce this delay when bypassed, in order to maintain automatic delay compensation with the rest of the project. In most cases, the effects of this behavior will be completely inaudible.</p><p>The neutrality of bypassed effects is tested by loading one instance of each of Live‘s effects devices into an audio track, deactivating them, and then rendering the output of the track. The rendered file is then compared to the rendered output of the same track with no loaded devices. Phase cancellation testing of the two files confirms that they are identical.</p></section><section id="routing" data-number="1.2.9"><h3 data-number="35.2.9"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.9</span> Routing</h3><p>The routing (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/routing-and-i-o/#routing-and-i-o">‘Routing and I/O’</a>) of signals within Live is a neutral operation. The signal at the routing destination will be identical to the signal at the routing source. It is important to note that Live‘s flexible routing architecture allows for a variety of scenarios, including routing from before or after any track‘s effects or mixer and tapping the output of individual sample slots within the Impulse instrument. In these cases, it is likely that the signal heard at the output point will be different from the signal heard prior to routing, because it has been tapped before reaching the end of its original signal chain.</p></section><section id="splitting-clips" data-number="1.2.10"><h3 data-number="35.2.10"><span class="header-section-number">35.2.10</span> Splitting Clips</h3><p>Clips which are already neutral will remain neutral after splitting (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/arrangement-view/#splitting-clips">‘Splitting Clips’</a>). Splitting only affects playback position within the sample, and has no effect on the sample data itself. Playback across a split boundary is seamless and sample-accurate.</p><p>The neutrality of clip splitting is tested under a variety of conditions:</p><ul><li>splitting unwarped clips with loop on and off;</li><li>splitting warped but unstretched clips with loop on and off;</li></ul><p>In all cases, output is rendered and compared with the output of an unsplit version of the same source. Phase cancellation testing of the two files confirms that they are identical.</p></section></section><section id="non-neutral-operations" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="35.3"><span class="header-section-number">35.3</span> Non-Neutral Operations</h2><p>Procedures in Live that will cause a change in audio quality are referred to as <em>non-neutral operations</em>. Users can be guaranteed that using these operations will cause at least some change to the signal. Applying non-neutral operations to files imported into Live ensures that the imported audio will differ from the files saved on disk. Applying non-neutral operations to files being exported from Live ensures that what you hear during realtime playback will be different from what will end up in your new file.</p><p>Non-neutral operations include:</p><section id="playback-in-complex-and-complex-pro-mode" data-number="1.3.1"><h3 data-number="35.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">35.3.1</span> Playback in Complex and Complex Pro Mode</h3><p>The algorithms used in the Complex (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#complex-mode">‘Complex Mode’</a>) and Complex Pro (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#complex-pro-mode">‘Complex Pro Mode’</a>) Warp modes use an entirely different technology from the algorithms behind Beats, Tones, Texture and Re-Pitch modes. Although the Complex modes may sound better, particularly when used with mixed sound files containing many different kinds of audio material, they are never neutral — not even at the original tempo. Because of this, and because of the increased CPU demands of these algorithms, we recommend using them only in cases where the other Warp modes don‘t produce sufficient results.</p></section><section id="sample-rate-conversiontransposition" data-number="1.3.2"><h3 data-number="35.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">35.3.2</span> Sample rate conversion/transposition</h3><p>Sample rate conversion (during both real-time playback and rendering) is a non-neutral operation. Playback of audio files at a sample rate that is different from the rate set in Live‘s Preferences window will cause signal degradation. Transposition is also a form of sample-rate conversion, and thus also results in non-neutral behavior.</p><p>To minimize potential negative results during real-time playback, it is recommended to do sample rate conversion as an offline process, rather than mixing files of different sample rates within a single Set. Once the samples have been exported at the sample rate that you plan to use in Live, the files can be imported without any loss of quality.</p><p>Rendering audio from Live with a sampling rate other than the one that was used while working on the project is also a non-neutral operation. As of Live 9.1, however, sample rate conversion during export uses the extremely high-quality SoX Resampler library <span class="footnote">(This product incorporates the <a href="https://soxr.sourceforge.net">SoX Resampler</a> library, as licensed under the <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses">GNU LGPL v2.1</a>.)</span>, which results in downsampled files with extremely low distortion.</p></section><section id="volume-automation" data-number="1.3.3"><h3 data-number="35.3.3"><span class="header-section-number">35.3.3</span> Volume Automation</h3><p>Automation of volume level results in a change in gain, which is necessarily a non-neutral operation. But certain implementations of automation envelopes can result in audible artifacts, particularly if the envelopes are not calculated at a fast enough rate. Since Live 7, volume automation curves are updated for each audio sample, resulting in extremely low levels of distortion.</p></section><section id="dithering" data-number="1.3.4"><h3 data-number="35.3.4"><span class="header-section-number">35.3.4</span> Dithering</h3><p>Whenever rendering audio to a lower bit depth, it is a good idea to apply dithering in order to minimize artifacts. Dithering (a kind of very low-level noise) is inherently a non-neutral procedure, but it is a necessary evil when lowering the bit resolution.</p><p>Please note that Live‘s internal signal processing is all 32-bit, so applying even a single gain change makes the resulting audio 32-bit as well — even if the original audio is 16- or 24-bit. Dither should never be applied more than once to any given audio file, so unless you are mastering and finalizing in Live, it is best to always render at 32-bit and avoid dithering altogether.</p></section><section id="recording-external-signals-bit-depth-ad-converter-1" data-number="1.3.5"><h3 data-number="35.3.5"><span class="header-section-number">35.3.5</span> Recording external signals (bit depth &lt; A/D converter)</h3><p>Recording audio signals into Live is a non-neutral operation if the bit depth set in Live‘s Preferences window is lower than that of the A/D converters used for the recording.

Specifically, the new files will be normalized, with their clip volumes adjusted to play back at the same volume as heard prior to consolidation. Normalization is a gain change, which is a non-neutral operation. Also, the new files will be created at the sample rate and bit depth set in Live‘s Preferences window, which may differ from those in the original audio files.</p></section><section id="clip-fades" data-number="1.3.8"><h3 data-number="35.3.8"><span class="header-section-number">35.3.8</span> Clip fades</h3><p>When Create Fades on Clip Edges is enabled in the Record, Warp &amp; Launch Preferences, a short (up to 4 ms) fade is applied to the clip start and end to avoid clicks at the clip edges. These “declicking“ fades can also be applied to Session View clips via the Clip Fade (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/clip-view/#clip-ram-mode">‘Clip RAM Mode’</a>) button. Additionally, Arrangement View clips have editable fades and crossfades (see <a href="/en/live-manual/12/arrangement-view/#audio-clip-fades-and-crossfades">‘Audio Clip Fades and Crossfades’</a>).

A DAW must be able to accommodate three distinct MIDI-related scenarios:</p><ol type="1"><li><em>Recording</em> refers to sending MIDI note and controller information from a hardware device (such as a MIDI keyboard) into a DAW for storage. An ideal recording environment would capture this incoming information with perfect timing accuracy in relation to the timeline of the song — as accurately as an audio recording.</li><li><em>Playback</em> refers to two related scenarios when dealing with DAWs. The first involves sending MIDI note and controller information from the DAW to a hardware device such as a synthesizer. The second involves converting stored MIDI information into audio data within the computer, as played back by a plug-in device such as the Operator synthesizer. In both cases, an ideal playback environment would output a perfect reproduction of the stored information.</li><li><em>Playthrough</em> involves sending MIDI note and controller information from a hardware device (such as a MIDI keyboard) into the DAW and then, in real-time, back out to a hardware synthesizer or to a plug-in device within the DAW. An ideal playthrough environment would “feel“ as accurate and responsive as a physical instrument such as a piano.</li></ol></section><section id="midi-timing-problems" data-number="1.2"><h2 data-number="36.2"><span class="header-section-number">36.2</span> MIDI Timing Problems</h2><p>The realities of computer-based MIDI are complex, and involve so many variables that the ideal systems described above are impossible to achieve. There are two fundamental issues:</p><ol type="1"><li><em>Latency</em> refers to inherent and consistent delay in a system. This is a particular problem in a DAW because digital audio cannot be transferred into or out of an audio interface in real time, and must instead be buffered. But even acoustic instruments exhibit a certain degree of latency; in a piano, for example, there is some amount of delay between the time a key is depressed and the time the hammer mechanism actually activates the string. From a performance perspective, small latency times are generally not a problem because players are usually able to adapt the timing of their playing to compensate for delays — as long as the delays remain consistent.</li><li><em>Jitter</em> refers to inconsistent or random delay in a system. Within a DAW, this can be a particular problem because different functions within the system (e.g., MIDI, audio and the user interface) are processed separately. Information often needs to be moved from one such process to another — when converting MIDI data into a plug-in‘s playback, for example. Jitter-free MIDI timing involves accurate conversion between different clocks within the system‘s components — the MIDI interface, audio interface, and the DAW itself. The accuracy of this conversion depends on a variety of factors, including the operating system and driver architecture used. Jitter, much more so than latency, creates the feeling that MIDI timing is “sloppy“ or “loose.“</li></ol></section><section id="lives-midi-solutions" data-number="1.3"><h2 data-number="36.3"><span class="header-section-number">36.3</span> Live’s MIDI Solutions</h2><p>Ableton‘s approach to MIDI timing is based on two key assumptions:</p><ol type="1"><li>In all cases, latency is preferable to jitter. Because latency is consistent and predictable, it can be dealt with much more easily by both computers and people.</li><li>If you are using playthrough while recording, you will want to record what you <em>hear</em> — even if, because of latency, this occurs slightly later than what you <em>play</em>.</li></ol><p>Live addresses the problems inherent in recording, playback and playthrough so that MIDI timing will be responsive, accurate and consistently reliable. In order to record incoming events to the correct positions in the timeline of a Live Set, Live needs to know exactly when those events were received from the MIDI keyboard. But Live cannot receive them directly — they must first be processed by the MIDI interface‘s drivers and the operating system. To solve this problem, the interface drivers give each MIDI event a <em>timestamp</em> as they receive it, and those are passed to Live along with the event so that Live knows exactly when the events should be added to the clip.</p><p>During playthrough, a DAW must constantly deal with events that should be heard as soon as possible, but which inevitably occurred in the past due to inherent latency and system delays. So a choice must be made: should events be played at the moment they are received (which can result in jitter if that moment happens to occur when the system is busy) or should they be delayed (which adds latency)? Ableton‘s choice is to add latency, as we believe that it is easier for users to adjust to consistent latency than to random jitter.</p><p>When monitoring is enabled during recording, Live adds an additional delay to the timestamp of the event based on the buffer size of your audio hardware. This added latency makes it possible to record events to the clip at the time you <em>hear</em> them — not the time you <em>play</em> them.</p><p>For playback of hardware devices, Live also generates timestamps that it attempts to communicate to the MIDI interface drivers for scheduling of outgoing MIDI events. Windows MME drivers cannot process timestamps, however, and for devices that use these drivers, Live schedules outgoing events internally.</p><p>Even during high system loads that cause audio dropouts, Live will continue to receive incoming MIDI events. In the event of audio dropouts, there may be timing errors and audio distortion during playthrough, but Live should still correctly record MIDI events into clips. Later, when the system has recovered from the dropouts, playback of these recorded events should be accurate.</p></section><section id="variables-outside-of-lives-control" data-number="1.4"><h2 data-number="36.4"><span class="header-section-number">36.4</span> Variables Outside of Live’s Control</h2><p>In general, timestamps are an extremely reliable mechanism for dealing with MIDI event timing. But timestamps are only applicable to data within the computer itself. MIDI data outside of the computer can make no use of this information, and so timing information coming from or going to external hardware is processed by the hardware as soon as it arrives, rather than according to a schedule. Additionally, MIDI cables are <em>serial</em>, meaning they can only send one piece of information at a time. In practice, this means that multiple notes played simultaneously cannot be transmitted simultaneously through MIDI cables, but instead must be sent one after the other. Depending on the density of the events, this can cause MIDI timing problems.</p><p>Another issue that can arise, particularly when working with hardware synthesizers from the early days of MIDI, is that the <em>scan time</em> of the device may occur at a relatively slow rate. Scan time refers to how often the synthesizer checks its own keyboard for input. If this rate is too slow, jitter may be introduced.</p><p>Of course, any such timing problems present at the hardware level may be multiplied as additional pieces of gear are added to the chain.</p><p>Even within the computer, the accuracy of timestamps can vary widely, depending on the quality of the MIDI hardware, errors in driver programming, etc. Live must assume that any timestamps attached to incoming MIDI events are accurate, and that outgoing events will be dealt with appropriately by any external hardware. But both situations are impossible for Live to verify.</p><p>Tests and Results</p><p>Our procedure for testing the timing of incoming MIDI events is represented in the following diagram:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MIDIInTestSetup.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>MIDI Input Test Configuration.</figcaption></figure><p>The output of a <em>MIDI Source</em> (a keyboard or other DAW playing long sequences of random MIDI events) is fed to a zero-latency hardware <em>MIDI Splitter</em>. One portion of the splitter‘s output is recorded into a new MIDI clip in Live. The other portion is fed to a <em>MIDI-to-Audio Converter</em>. This device converts the electrical signal from the MIDI source into simple audio noise. Because the device does not interpret the MIDI data, it performs this conversion with zero-latency. The converter‘s output is then recorded into a new audio clip in Live. In an ideal system, each event in the MIDI clip would occur simultaneously with the corresponding event in the audio clip. Thus the difference in timing between the MIDI and audio events in the two clips can be measured to determine Live‘s accuracy.</p><p>In order to assess MIDI performance under a variety of conditions, we ran the tests with three different audio/MIDI combo interfaces at different price points, all from well-known manufacturers. We will refer to these interfaces as A, B and C. All tests were performed with a CPU load of approximately 50% on both macOS and Windows machines, at both 44.1 and 96 kHz and at three different audio buffer sizes, for a total of 36 discrete test configurations.</p><p>Windows:</p><ul><li>Interface A: The maximum jitter was +/- 4 ms, with the majority of the jitter occurring at +/- 1 ms.</li><li>Interface B: For most of the tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 3 or 4 ms. At 96 kHz and 1024 sample buffer, there were a small number of events with +/- 5 ms of jitter. At 44.1 kHz and 512 sample buffer, occasional events with +/- 6 ms occurred. In all cases, the majority of the jitter occurred at +/- 1 ms.</li><li>Interface C: For most of the tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 5 ms. At 96 kHz and 512 sample buffer, there were a small number of events with between +/- 6 and 8 ms of jitter. At 44.1 kHz and 1024 sample buffer, there were a small number of events with jitter as high as +/- 10 ms. In all cases, the majority of the jitter occurred at +/- 1 ms.</li></ul><p>macOS:</p><ul><li>Interface A: At 44.1 kHz and 1152 sample buffer, jitter was fairly evenly distributed between +/- 4 and 11 ms. For all other tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 5 ms. In all tests, the majority of the jitter occurred at +/- 1 ms.</li><li>Interface B: For most of the tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 4 or 5 ms. At 44.1 kHz and 1152 sample buffer, there was a fairly even distribution of jitter between +/- 2 and 11 ms. In all cases, the majority of the jitter occurred at +/- 1 ms.</li><li>Interface C: In all tests, the maximum jitter was +/- 1 ms, with most events occurring with no jitter.</li></ul><p>We also performed a similar procedure for testing the timing of outgoing MIDI events, as represented in the following diagram:</p><figure class="image-container"><img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/live-manual/12/MIDIOutTestSetup.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=320"><figcaption>MIDI Output Test Configuration.</figcaption></figure><p>In all cases, the output tests showed comparable results to the input tests.</p></section><section id="tips-for-achieving-optimal-midi-performance" data-number="1.5"><h2 data-number="36.5"><span class="header-section-number">36.5</span> Tips for Achieving Optimal MIDI Performance</h2><p>In order to help users achieve optimal MIDI performance with Live, we have provided a list of recommended practices and program settings.</p><ul><li>Use the lowest possible buffer sizes available on your audio hardware, thereby keeping latency to a minimum. Audio buffer controls are found in the Audio tab of Live‘s Preferences, and vary depending on the type of hardware you‘re using. For more information, see the Lesson “Setting Up Audio I/O.“</li><li>Use a high quality MIDI interface with the most current drivers in order to ensure that MIDI timestamps are generated and processed as accurately as possible.</li><li>Do <em>not</em> enable track monitoring if you are recording MIDI while listening directly to a hardware device such as an external synthesizer (as opposed to listening to the device‘s audio through Live via the External Instrument device). Likewise, disable track monitoring when recording MIDI data that is generated by another MIDI device (such as a drum machine). When monitoring is enabled, Live adds latency to compensate for playthrough jitter. Therefore, it is important to only enable monitoring when actually playing through.</li></ul></section><section id="summary-and-conclusions" data-number="1.6"><h2 data-number="36.6"><span class="header-section-number">36.6</span> Summary and Conclusions</h2><p>Ableton wrote this paper in order to help users understand a variety of related topics:</p><ul><li>the inherent problems in computer-based MIDI systems;</li><li>our approach to solving these problems in Live;</li><li>additional variables that we cannot account for.</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the best way to solve MIDI timing issues in your studio is to use the highest-quality hardware components available.
